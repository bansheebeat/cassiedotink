It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a long time,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but I finally felt I had the time, understanding of Hugo templates, and workflow with Obsidian to make it happen. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty empty right now and therefore I appear as a rube who has read only one and half books, but luckily I was able to add a miniscule disclaimer to the bottom of the page that defends my reputation (reproduced below).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started tracking the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read in November of 2025. I have read way more than this! It is important to me to establish this credibility because I have half of an English degree and teach English as a day job!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did a few other little tweaks here and there around the site. Maybe when I have time I&amp;rsquo;ll do a proper little write-up of the aberrant and unsound process by which I created the bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, this week was Thanksgiving.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Joe and I went to his family for it, which was mostly fine. No major drama, but it&amp;rsquo;s only there that I feel completely anti-social and unable to make conversation. After we got back, it was nice to have some downtime around the house to rest and relax — being sick for something like the last month has left me without a good night&amp;rsquo;s rest in some time. I&amp;rsquo;m on the upswing, though, and I was able to resume my Sunday Runday routine with a friend (though our runs have moved to an indoor track what with the cold weather).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with my college course, and I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting to hear back on the logistics behind my move to the high school. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to (as much as is possible for me) coast through the next few weeks of teaching middle school and instead focus on preparing for the change, but I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that I am in some ways a phenomenally impatient person: once I set my mind to doing something — like changing jobs — I hate waiting for it to happen, but I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to phone things in entirely for the month or two that I have left. It&amp;rsquo;s the being caught between things that frustrates me; when I do something, I jump in with my whole heart. I just want to take that plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I re-read Gene Luen Yang&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/books/american-born-chinese/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Born Chinese&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the last text for my college course. I first read this nine years ago when I took the class; I remember enjoying it and finding the twist novel. This time around, I flew through and was surprised by how much of it I remembered — in my head, it was a lot longer and more complicated. It&amp;rsquo;s a book I would have considered for my middle school curriculum if I was staying at the grade level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; much this week what with the travel and trying to burn through &lt;em&gt;American Born Chinese&lt;/em&gt;. I am resolved to finish it before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone back to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m still really enjoying it, though the long breaks I&amp;rsquo;ve taken have left me a little lost when it comes to all the different factions and individuals vying for power in the game&amp;rsquo;s plot. I really like a lot of the major characters (Delita, mostly, and Agrias), and so I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to focus more on their individual, emotional journeys rather than all the intricate political machinations. I&amp;rsquo;m keeping up with the broad strokes of the story just fine, but it seems like a notable change from the me of 15 years ago that read the entire &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; codex, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to attribute that to. The lore of &lt;em&gt;Tactics&lt;/em&gt; is much drier, I suppose, and I think my priorities have changed along with the time I have to actually sit down and play games — now that my play sessions are fewer and farther between, I&amp;rsquo;m not really eager to spend them reading a damn book off the screen.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://album.link/b/4022399652&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apologies to the Queen Mary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; several times over on Saturday night; I&amp;rsquo;d listened to it before and frequently returned to songs like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll Believe in Anything&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Grounds for Divorce,&amp;rdquo; but the rest of it got lost in the mix. It&amp;rsquo;s worth listening to full through as a complete album, but previously overlooked tracks like &amp;ldquo;Modern World&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a Curse&amp;rdquo; are really hitting right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://symfonium.app/&#34;&gt;Symfonium&lt;/a&gt; for my mobile listening. I am having issues with Plexamp scrobbling my plays, and I like that Symfonium is open source and platform agnostic. Symfonium isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as pretty as Plexamp (though it is very customizable), and it seems to dump all the scrobbles with the timestamp of when I came back online, but these are minor pain points so far. I still wish there was a version for the desktop, but maybe there are other options I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since my plays aren&amp;rsquo;t tracking correctly, this is based on specious data, but here&amp;rsquo;s my  ten for the week — I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting on my notebook to come in to start doing these on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fancy Claps&amp;rdquo; by Wolf Parade&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Modern World&amp;rdquo; by Wolf Parade&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Adult Acne Stigmata&amp;rdquo; by Los Campesinos!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be Nice to Me&amp;rdquo; by The Front Bottoms&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Thunder and It&amp;rsquo;s Lightning&amp;rdquo; by We Were Promised Jetpacks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Think It Would be Great&amp;rdquo; by Best Friends Forever&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Champagne Girls I Have Known&amp;rdquo; by Johnny Foreigner&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;international thirst champion&amp;rdquo; by Kitty&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;hand crushed by a mallet&amp;rdquo; by 100 gecs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;getting it on&amp;rdquo; by SALES&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2025/12/1) -&lt;/strong&gt; It looks like I might have resolved my syncing issues. I was originally using &lt;a href=&#34;https://eavesdrop.fm/&#34;&gt;eavesdrop.fm&lt;/a&gt; to sync Plex data to ListenBrainz (I don&amp;rsquo;t really use or check last.fm anymore). Because I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with remote access issues with my Plex server, eavesdrop.fm wasn&amp;rsquo;t picking up the plays, as it requires a persistent connection to the server. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the eavesdrop webhook and am now using ListenBrainz&amp;rsquo;s automatic last.fm import tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this was one of the many reasons I moved back to hugo from bearblog; I wanted to build out more content and turn this site into the next pdf&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this is a pattern that holds me back from starting a lot of things: for some reason I have it in my head that everything has to be all encompassing, i.e. include every book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read or every thought I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had, and since it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to backfill all that, I never start. I am working to resist that urge. Rome wasn&amp;rsquo;t built in a day etc.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(un)objectively the worst holiday&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if the book isn&amp;rsquo;t eligible to go on my reading tracker does it even count as reading&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;This week was &lt;em&gt;nuts&lt;/em&gt;. Oh, and I&amp;rsquo;m sick again (still?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My birthday was Monday; I went right from teaching middle school to teaching my college course in the evening. I got home around 7:00pm, showered, ate dinner, and felt down — not because I had a particularly bad day, but it just felt like a bunch of stress came crashing upon me and like there was no way out. I guess I hoped something completely arbitrary like a birthday would wash away the weeks of discontent, but alas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t get into the play-by-play, to protect the privacy of the people involved and because it really isn&amp;rsquo;t that interesting to you, reader, but on Tuesday, I caught wind that there was a sudden opening in the English department at the high school in my district. By Friday, I was (tearfully) letting my middle schoolers know that I had made the decision to take the job and would be moving on around the end of January. It&amp;rsquo;s been a real rollercoaster — a plain example of how one&amp;rsquo;s life can change in moments. I wrote out an email to my current coworkers explaining the decision, which I&amp;rsquo;ll reproduce in part here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I became a teacher for three reasons: I love literature, I love writing, and I love children. I have the best job in the world because I get to fulfill those passions every day. But increasingly in the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve longed for the literature that you find at the high school level, the writing that you can push older kids to do, and most of all, seeing kids grow as readers and thinkers over several years&amp;hellip; Ordinarily, I&amp;rsquo;d never dream of leaving a job midyear like this, but opportunity came knocking, and I&amp;rsquo;m not one to turn it down. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a heavy heart the last few days as I weighed the decision, the foremost of which is that I hate to leave my students in the middle of the year like this. But I also know that this isn&amp;rsquo;t goodbye — it&amp;rsquo;s see you later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been giddy — and anxious and hysterical and paranoid and about a dozen other emotions — ever since I made the decision. I know it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of work, a huge challenge to adjust to a new building and culture. But there&amp;rsquo;s so much that I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to, and I feel newly invigorated by the prospect of a fresh start and a new adventure. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of logistics to figure out, but I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled. More to come on this in the weeks ahead!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the weekend, I played around with Jellyfin a bit. I&amp;rsquo;m currently pretty deep into Plex but would prefer to use open source software. I found Jellyfin to be a bit slow and clunky (which could well be a limitation of my server) on both the web app and the Roku app, but it&amp;rsquo;s mostly useable for movies and TV. I hit a lot more walls for my music. I have a library approaching 20k songs&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time combing through on Plex (Plexamp, specifically) to star tracks, build playlists, etc. I probably could transfer that with a not insignificant amount of effort, but the bigger hurdle is where to listen. I&amp;rsquo;ve played around with Symfonium on my phone (which already supports Plex) and like it well enough, but there&amp;rsquo;s no desktop parallel. I could go back to foobar2000, but I like having one app that&amp;rsquo;s synchronized across desktop and mobile. So it seems I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with Plex/Plexamp for the time being.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also really excited that &lt;a href=&#34;https://omglol.news/2025/11/20/say-hello-to-sourcetube-the-omg-lol-community-code-forge&#34;&gt;omg.lol recently started a Forgejo instance&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a happy customer with them for over a year, and while I recently migrated my git repos to &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie&#34;&gt;32bitcafe&amp;rsquo;s Gitea&lt;/a&gt;, they don&amp;rsquo;t have a working Actions workflow, so I&amp;rsquo;m right now mirroring the repo to Github and then deploying to Cloudflare Pages. Once omg.lol launches an Actions Runner on Forgejo, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to set up a build script that deploys to (probably) Nearly Free Speech so I can start ending my reliance on Microsoft and Cloudflare. I am shocked I just wrote all of those sentences because a year or two ago, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how git worked at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m still really new to it, and I know it will be a headache for me to figure out how to get that all working, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to do it! Once I figure things out, I&amp;rsquo;ll do a proper write up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last week, I re-read (listened to the audiobook) of &lt;em&gt;Little Brother&lt;/em&gt; by Cory Doctorow in preparation for discussing it in my college course. That discussion centered a lot around screen time and the role we give technology in our lives and our students&amp;rsquo; lives. That&amp;rsquo;s distant from Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s themes — the book is largely about technology as a tool for opposing fascism — and that&amp;rsquo;s maybe on me for poorly framing the conversation, but it was interesting conversation and that&amp;rsquo;s what matters. I started the class off by having everyone (including me) look at their screen time for the day. I sheepishly admitted that mine was nearly three hours, the most significant of which was &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/Hague/forkyz&#34;&gt;Forkyz&lt;/a&gt; because I do the New York Times Crossword most mornings.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I did direct the conversation toward considering the apps we&amp;rsquo;re using and whether we trust them with our data, but I was shocked to find most of my students reporting 10 to 13 hours in a single day. A single day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could have walked away from that conversation patting myself on the back for my comparatively minimal screen time, but instead I felt even more pressed to do something before mine spins out of control.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many of the students tried to pose screen time as self-care, a break from the stressors of being a college student, and they suggested that they&amp;rsquo;re watching YouTube videos as an alternative to doomscrolling. They suggested the same for me: that education is such a tremendously stressful career that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to come home and just passively scroll to recover. I&amp;rsquo;ve often felt the same way, but — perhaps returning to some of the themes of &lt;em&gt;Little Brother&lt;/em&gt; — I also think that&amp;rsquo;s a form of social control.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We are so dispirited and drained by capitalist society and the phones keep us distracted from initiating real social change and participation in alternative culture. So consider this a reaffirmation of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/002/&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/006/&#34;&gt;oblique&lt;/a&gt; goals to reduce my screen time and focus more on shit that actually matters. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m constantly writing here about how I&amp;rsquo;m making glacial progress through &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt;, yet here I am spending 20 minutes a day on fucking Facebook doing god knows what.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I&amp;rsquo;ve taken:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Removed shortcuts to most social media apps on my homescreen. All that&amp;rsquo;s left is Discord (which I barely use these days), Mastodon, Snapchat (low usage), and tumblr (a few days a week — it makes me laugh).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Put a big screen time tracking widget on the now empty space on my homescreen in hopes that, when I unlock my phone, I see where I am for the day and make informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Added app timer limits for Facebook and Reddit (10 mins/day). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to eventually get those to zero, but I used this strategy when I wanted to quit Instagram a while back and it worked.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ReadYouApp/ReadYou&#34;&gt;Read You&lt;/a&gt; widget to my homescreen to replace my mindless scrolling with RSS feeds of blogs written by actual people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The honest truth is that I love technology and being on the computer. I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily looking to eliminate that from my life, but I do want to be more conscious of where I am spending that time (i.e. independent, decentralized spaces online that aren&amp;rsquo;t stealing my data) and the loss of idle time. When I actually sit down at my desk and use my computer, I&amp;rsquo;m productive (grading, planning lessons, etc.), working on projects (this blog and my home server, which is increasingly a pathway to get away from giant corporate apps), or interacting with meaningful culture (listening to music). That&amp;rsquo;s all worth keeping, I think, but I need to reclaim the time I&amp;rsquo;m losing to mindless scrolling and replace it with things that are more worthwhile. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always like this! I want to go back to a world before all the apps and the social media. Some of it can still be digital, but it has to be a digital that &lt;em&gt;adds&lt;/em&gt; to my life. I used to read books! I used to play games! Now I just lament every week that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time for those things while spending hours on Poshmark because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to open an app than crack a book. But I want to start using my brain again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still making extremely slow progress through &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt;; I was worse this week than last because of everything I had going on, work-wise, but now that I&amp;rsquo;m going to be teaching high school, I feel I must re-establish my literary authority and start burning through some classics.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished season two of &lt;em&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s probably still my favorite season of the show, but I recall thinking it was astonishingly good when it first came out. It does not quite reach the same crescendos for me this time around, but I&amp;rsquo;m still watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I are now I guess going through the commentaries for &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to some of them over the years, both with and without him, but we did &lt;em&gt;Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Two Towers&lt;/em&gt; this week. He&amp;rsquo;s only really interested in the cast commentaries for now, so I might do the others on my own at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up on Saturday and thought of &amp;ldquo;Windmills of Your Mind&amp;rdquo; by Parenthetical Girls for the first time in a long time, so I bought their discography off Bandcamp&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and skipped around through some old favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goodflyingbirds.bandcamp.com/album/talulahs-tape&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talulah&amp;rsquo;s Tape&lt;/em&gt; by good flying birds&lt;/a&gt; was featured on Bandcamp, so I listened through that. It&amp;rsquo;s good — &amp;ldquo;wallace,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;pulling hair,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;last straw&amp;rdquo; were my standouts, but the whole thing is nice sleepy indie rock. The band &lt;a href=&#34;https://goodflyingbirds.neocities.org/&#34;&gt;has a a really cool site&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to Slothrust&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://slothrust.bandcamp.com/album/the-pact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s OK, but I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://slothrust.bandcamp.com/album/of-course-you-do&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of Course You Do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I gave &lt;em&gt;Mass Romantic&lt;/em&gt; by The New Pornographers a proper listen. A coworker &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/021/&#34;&gt;recommended them a while back&lt;/a&gt;. I really like &amp;ldquo;Breakin&amp;rsquo; the Law,&amp;rdquo; but the rest didn&amp;rsquo;t hold much of a shine for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Los Campesinos! are &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/album/a-los-campesinos-christmas-2025-remaster&#34;&gt;re-pressing their Christmas album&lt;/a&gt;; I was able to snag the limited edition vinyl before it sold out. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been much of a fan of their Christmas songs — truthfully I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever properly sat down to listen through to the album — but they&amp;rsquo;ve discussed wanting to reissue all of their albums on vinyl and it seems as good a time as any to try to collect them all. I already have all their Heart Swells 7&amp;quot;s,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so the hard part is through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my song list for the week:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;pulling hair&amp;rdquo; by good flying birds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;bones&amp;rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Windmills of Your Mind&amp;rdquo; by Parenthetical Girls&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nowhere Fast&amp;rdquo; by The Smiths&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Travel Bug&amp;rdquo; by Slothrust&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Racing Gloves&amp;rdquo; by Plumtree&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wolfman&amp;rdquo; by The Front Bottoms&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lemonade Grrrl&amp;rdquo; by Joanna Newsom&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It Shits!!!&amp;rdquo; by Bomb the Music Industry!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We Are All Accelerated Readers&amp;rdquo; by Los Campesinos! (three weeks strong)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;véronique &lt;a href=&#34;https://veronique.ink/moonbow-3/&#34;&gt;posts photos of her zines in her blog posts&lt;/a&gt; which often contain lists of things she&amp;rsquo;s into at the moment. I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to try the same thing for these song lists! I&amp;rsquo;ve bought a notebook on JetPens to use for this.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m cool or creative enough to get into making zines (yet?), but perhaps this is a toe in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this is sicko-level shit&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not particularly unhappy with Plex, to be clear,  but it is a closed-source app and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I trust them with my data.

I finally feel like I&amp;rsquo;m getting above water on my work, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been coming home at better times.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Part of it is that I&amp;rsquo;ve accepted that my students this year are incredibly behind in their reading and writing skills and I have slowed my instruction way down as a result — not to &amp;ldquo;dumb it down&amp;rdquo; but to build good, strong foundations for them. I can&amp;rsquo;t just pass the problem along to the next grade. This probably means that we&amp;rsquo;re not going to get through the same amount of content as I usually do in an instructional year, but I&amp;rsquo;m lucky in that I teach a skills subject, not a content subject.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m mostly on the upswing from being sick as well. On Friday, I got my flu and COVID shots (which I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). My cough is still present but less frequent and severe. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to be fully recovered by Thanksgiving, when I&amp;rsquo;ll be thrust into the petri dish of Joe&amp;rsquo;s unvaccinated family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Socially, I met up with some friends (including one who moved far out of town) for drinks on Friday, and on Sunday, I restarted my Sunday running with my friend (we&amp;rsquo;d skipped the last week due to illness, and the week before that was a 5K we&amp;rsquo;d signed up for). I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have the Sunday run in particular — I know I feel better mentally when I&amp;rsquo;m getting outside and being active, and we use the run to debrief on work and go into our weeks with our burdens lightened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading a few pages of &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; every morning while I eat breakfast. It&amp;rsquo;s a slow way of getting through a hefty book, but it is at least some progress — and a habit I&amp;rsquo;m happy to establish as it replaces the doomscrolling that I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I re-read the first 50 pages or so of &lt;em&gt;Pet&lt;/em&gt; by Akwaeke Emezi in preparation for my college class. I still love that book, but I was disappointed that most of my students seemed either confused by it or just didn&amp;rsquo;t read it. I think the latter is more prevalent and probably feeds into the former: some of the concepts and plot events of the book probably are confusing when you&amp;rsquo;re reading a summary online, but it was troubling to think a junior or senior in college doing an English Education degree program would struggle with a young adult text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my college class next week, we&amp;rsquo;re covering &lt;em&gt;Little Brother&lt;/em&gt; by Cory Doctorow. I first read the book nine years ago when I took the course as a student and remember liking it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t recall it in specific detail, so I decided to try listening to the audiobook while playing &lt;em&gt;Pokemon&lt;/em&gt;. This was the first audiobook I&amp;rsquo;d listened to start to finish and I am proud to say that I have been right all these years: audiobooks are not for me. I zone out and miss things, and I don&amp;rsquo;t get to do my silly little annotations. It was a quick way to blow through the book, and I definitely grasped the main swath of the plot, but reading is more than that for me.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The book is probably even more relevant today than it was when it was first written in terms of the surveillance that happens through technology, the need for open online spaces, and the threat of fascism taking hold in America. I did find it cloying (though a necessity) that a solid chunk of the book was dedicated to explaining things like key pairs and Tor browsers. Doctorow does a good job of explaining these things in comprehensible terms for the average person, and of course the average reader would be lost without these explanations — I acknowledge I&amp;rsquo;m in the minority of readers of young adult fiction in understanding the basics of these things — but it did get exhausting. I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see how my Gen Z students will react to the book and whether it will help me on my road to forgiving them over &lt;em&gt;Pet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I watched &lt;em&gt;Cunk on Earth&lt;/em&gt; after I saw some silly screenshots of it on tumblr. It was great! We also rewatched the back half of &lt;em&gt;Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt; that we slept through a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still rewatching &lt;em&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;, primarily while I fold laundry, and am enjoying it. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely a better show than &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt;, but I still don&amp;rsquo;t feel compelled to watch every season like I did &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m near the end of season two and might go into season three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve continued on with &lt;em&gt;Legends ZA&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not super keen on it. I accepted that the game&amp;rsquo;s main conceit was moving through the ZA Royale as compared to the Pokédex grind in &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt;, but then the game unceremoniously jumps you from Rank W (I think) to F in one swoop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It feels like the game just can&amp;rsquo;t commit to doing one thing well. There&amp;rsquo;s some lightly parkour-style traversal, but it&amp;rsquo;s bad; there&amp;rsquo;s the Wild Areas, but the catching mechanics don&amp;rsquo;t feel as fluid and satisfying as &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt;; the Rogue Mega Evolution battles are a fight with the controls and the camera; and the ZA Royale had novelty but is half-baked and shallow. The game wants you to use stealth, but you have few tools in your arsenal (gone are the berries and other distractions from &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt;) and the city isn&amp;rsquo;t built with effective cover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also find most of the characters insufferable. Your core group in the game fits the typical Pokémon tropes: there&amp;rsquo;s the airhead, the happy-go-lucky rival, and the mope. The script of the game reaches for modern slang but feels dated, and I just played through a bizarre sequence where a streamer&amp;rsquo;s hologram held an in-person fan quiz convention and asked parasocial questions to obsessive fans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It stinks to be so down on the game; when I saw positive reviews after release, I was happy that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to be doing something right, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve outgrown modern Pokémon — or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just not for me anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ve considered going back to &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt; to wrap up the story, finish the Pokédex, and just feel what I loved so much about it again. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Lazarus&lt;/em&gt; Is out now too, so I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about giving that a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to Rainbow Kitten Surprise&amp;rsquo;s newest album, &lt;em&gt;bones&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s good but not great. For reference, I think &lt;em&gt;RKS&lt;/em&gt; is basically a perfect album (except for &amp;ldquo;Run,&amp;rdquo; which sucks); I really like &lt;em&gt;Seven + Mary&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;How to: Friend, Love, Freefall&lt;/em&gt;; and while I think &lt;em&gt;Love Hate Music Box&lt;/em&gt; needed an editor, I appreciate how it tries to move their sound in a new direction.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;bones&lt;/em&gt; feels like an attempt to rollback the pop-oriented &lt;em&gt;Love Hate Music Box&lt;/em&gt; and return to the refined rock of &lt;em&gt;How to&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RKS&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s missing the sparkle those two had. Instead, it feels like a band that&amp;rsquo;s simply comfortable in a sound. That&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing, but it lacks the magic and sparkle of its two heaviest influences. &amp;ldquo;Hell Nah,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;bones,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Tropics&amp;rdquo; were the highlights for me, but none of them are even close to &lt;em&gt;RKS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;How to&lt;/em&gt; for me. They&amp;rsquo;re songs I don&amp;rsquo;t mind to have in the background, whereas I consciously return to songs like &amp;ldquo;Cold Love,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;All&amp;rsquo;s Well That Ends,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Moody Orange&amp;rdquo; constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://null818.bandcamp.com/album/null&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NULL&lt;/em&gt; by NULL&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavelengths.online/posts/a-good-ep-null-ep-by-null&#34;&gt;Brendon Bigley&amp;rsquo;s recommendation&lt;/a&gt; and found it  borderline unlistenable. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind noise punk (&lt;a href=&#34;https://prrfectpussy.bandcamp.com/track/i&#34;&gt;Perfect Pussy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is an all-timer for me), but this absolutely did not hit. At least it was short.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I woke up Friday morning with Blondie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Hanging on the Telephone&amp;rdquo; stuck in my head and therefore am listening to a lot of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my top ten songs for this week:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hanging on the Telephone&amp;rdquo; by Blondie&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We Are All Accelerated Readers&amp;rdquo; by Los Campesinos!

I realize that, in a subject like history, the expectation is that they cover a certain time period where presumably the next grade will pick up after — but I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that the skills are still what&amp;rsquo;s important, not whether the class covers every battle in the civil war.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;one year I had AWFUL body aches after and was out of order for two days, so now I look for a weekend where I have nothing else going on&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that audiobooks are reading and I know they work for some people. That&amp;rsquo;s great! Anything that gets folks engaging with literature and that makes literature more accessible is wonderful. I&amp;rsquo;m really not trying to be elitist here: they&amp;rsquo;re just not for me.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d have been happy with more of what they had been doing, of course, but I also appreciate a band that innovates and evolves.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

As I wrote last week, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lingering cough for going on two weeks. I visited urgent care and received a non-specific diagnosis, but they gave me an inhaler and said to come back if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t better in a week or two. On Wednesday or Thursday, I came down with a regular cold. It&amp;rsquo;s manageable, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it knocks whatever the cough was out of my system, but it feels like I can&amp;rsquo;t catch a break. Joe has been sick too, so we&amp;rsquo;ve been barely making it by; the house is messy and there are a lot of  projects that I&amp;rsquo;d like to get to, but neither of us have felt up it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been drowning in work. Last weekend and early this week, I finally caught up on grading for my middle schoolers and filed report cards. I&amp;rsquo;m at last in a good place there, but I have a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of grading to catch up on for my college course now. That grading luckily goes pretty quick — I only have eleven students in the class — but it&amp;rsquo;s been weighing on the back of my mind anytime I have a free moment. We are winding down with the class now — we only have I think four more sessions — and I&amp;rsquo;m thinking a lot about whether I would teach it again. It&amp;rsquo;s only offered in the fall, so I have time to think about it, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say what my life is going to look like a year from now. I have enjoyed teaching the class and working with older students, but it&amp;rsquo;s also an added workload that I just don&amp;rsquo;t need. The extra money is nice, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth the time and energy I&amp;rsquo;m putting in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My birthday is coming up next week and Joe asked if there was anything I&amp;rsquo;d like to do. I had a big party last year to celebrate turning 30 and had a really nice time&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but 31 doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like such a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a meta-level, I had some weirdness with this site deploying; right now, everything is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie/cassiedotink&#34;&gt;32bitcafe&amp;rsquo;s Gitea instance&lt;/a&gt;, which then mirrors to a Github repo. That Github repo is attached to Cloudflare Pages, which builds, deploys, and serves the website for me. Some media (images, mostly) is hosted on a bunny.net storage zone. It ended up being a minor problem with 32bitcafe, which they resolved quickly after I pointed it out. Broadly, though, I&amp;rsquo;d like to cut out my dependency on Github and maybe even Cloudflare. &lt;a href=&#34;https://burgeonlab.com/blog/hosting-static-sites-with-github-pages-or-bunny-net/&#34;&gt;Naty has success pushing from a repo to bunny&lt;/a&gt;, but I just haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to sit down and hash it out. Maybe other my winter break in a few weeks. I do think I need to stop trying to use Obsidian Sync &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the obsidian-git plugin at the same time and focus just on the latter.

I don&amp;rsquo;t know realistically that that&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d actually want to do, but it probably says something that podcasting is still in my subconscious. I did briefly think that, once my college class ends, I could use that block of time to podcast instead&amp;hellip; We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read a bit more of &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; this week. It&amp;rsquo;s still quite slow-going — I maybe only read fifteen pages — but it&amp;rsquo;s not a thrilling, plot-heavy book, so it almost feels like small weekly check-ins on Lucy Snowe. I&amp;rsquo;d like to develop the habit of reading a few pages while I eat my breakfast in the morning and then a few more before I go to bed. The former is doable, but with the latter, I usually nod off too quickly for it to really be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished off &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt; and moved on to rewatching &lt;em&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;. I really loved the first two seasons of &lt;em&gt;OitNB&lt;/em&gt; when they first came out (and I think I intend to only rewatch them, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the prison riot turn or what happened after that). I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it on the rewatch, but I&amp;rsquo;m not as taken with it as I was back then. I think it felt really revolutionary and fresh at the time, but ten plus years on, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like such a big thing to have queer women and women of color on the screen. I&amp;rsquo;m happy for that, of course! I&amp;rsquo;m still early in season one, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to any of the big storytelling swings and maybe my opinion will change then. I also remember a lot more of the jokes than I expected, so there&amp;rsquo;s a bit less novelty this time around, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends ZA&lt;/em&gt; using the virtual game card borrowing from Joe&amp;rsquo;s system. I&amp;rsquo;m tepid on it; it&amp;rsquo;s definitely miles ahead of &lt;em&gt;Scarlet&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Violet&lt;/em&gt;, which I thought had some good ideas but was executed so poorly that it turned me off of Pokémon, I think, in a pretty big way. But I loved &lt;em&gt;Legends Arceus&lt;/em&gt; so, so much and I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed that this game isn&amp;rsquo;t hitting the same notes for me. &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavelengths.online/posts/why-pokemon-legends-works&#34;&gt;Brendon Bigley wrote a bit about going into &lt;em&gt;ZA&lt;/em&gt; after loving &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having now spent around 15 hours running around Pokémon’s version of Paris, I’m starting to better understand what makes a Legends game in comparison to the mainline entries: It’s not an exploration of the history of the pokémon world, it’s an exploration of a specific time and place in the Pokémon world. A fulcrum point in their society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose then that maybe the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t the game itself but rather my hopes and expectations for it. But &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt; had such a strong, refreshing vibe that &lt;em&gt;ZA&lt;/em&gt; so far hasn&amp;rsquo;t surfaced for me. There&amp;rsquo;s some vague techno-futurism, but it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise just a (lovingly realized, detailed, well-executed — words I can&amp;rsquo;t use to describe any other recent Pokémon games) city in the Pokémon universe. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if it eventually sinks its claws into me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened through to &lt;em&gt;Infra&lt;/em&gt; by Max Richter for the first time in probably close to ten years. This album was once the background when I&amp;rsquo;d write (mostly Star Wars fanfiction). I was looking for something low-key to have on while grading, but I found a sense memory in it and added to my vault of unpublishable personal writing.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my top ten songs from the week (based somewhat on plays, with edits):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moody Orange&amp;rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Infra 5&amp;rdquo; by Max Richter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cold Love&amp;rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Sea is a Good Place to Think of the Future&amp;rdquo; by Los Campesinos!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bubble in My Bloodstream&amp;rdquo; by Martha&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Love Machine&amp;rdquo; by Being Dead&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pure Particles&amp;rdquo; by The Bug Club&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tenuousness&amp;rdquo; by Andrew Bird&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Breakin&amp;rsquo; the Law&amp;rdquo; by The New Pornographers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;We Are All Accelerated Readers&amp;rdquo; by Los Campesinos!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Rainbow Kitten Surprise&amp;rsquo;s new album (&lt;em&gt;bones&lt;/em&gt;) at the time of writing, but I want to sit with it longer before typing up any thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this was the first birthday party I&amp;rsquo;d ever had&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have one for work and one for writing&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this is becoming a running joke for me on my shitty little blog. to be clear, I think often about publishing on this blog the more creative (mostly creative non-fiction) writing that I do instead of banal accountings of everything I did and watched and played and listened to each week, but sharing my writing — especially publicly — is perhaps my primary phobia&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;This is an amalgamation of whatever I can remember over the last few weeks. I am almost certainly missing things, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to reset and start up again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I really just feel like shit. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a cough for going on a week and a half. According to urgent care, it&amp;rsquo;s a post-viral lingering cough. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember having something viral, but, well, teaching middle school means I&amp;rsquo;m exposed to all kinds of nasty shit. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to not have any other symptoms, but the cough has kept me up at night and indirectly given me a sore throat. And then, mentally, I&amp;rsquo;m going through phases. There are days where I feel totally blank, empty, detached — and then days where I feel so stressed, so angry, and completely unable to do anything about it. I took on teaching a college class this semester because I stepped back from some commitments at my full-time job and because I am at a place where I basically have my entire curriculum set for the year. Unfortunately, I am never satisfied and am constantly rebuilding and reworking entire units, and I have an incredibly challenging group this year in terms of behaviors. I feel like my heart just isn&amp;rsquo;t in it this year — or, it is, but it&amp;rsquo;s being beaten out every day by the horseshit I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with. I&amp;rsquo;m drowning in grading (especially for the college class — I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt; behind). I stay for hours after school and it feels like I hardly make a dent. I keep telling myself that things will get better, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see that light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have gone deeper into the world of fountain pens. I bought a LAMY Safari and Pilot Kakuno, both in extra fine; I like both but prefer the Kakuno (as it&amp;rsquo;s slightly thinner). I also bought a converter for my Preppy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m using it right — I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m hardly pulling any ink. I might just try refilling cartridges with a syringe. I will repeat my call for any fountain pen sickos reading this to please give me guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;Accountable&lt;/em&gt; by Dashka Slater because the deadline was up for the book group I joined. I enjoyed reading and discussing it, and it&amp;rsquo;s upsetting how relevant it is to my school and experiences with today&amp;rsquo;s students. The events at Albany are in no way an anomaly. I wish perhaps that the book offered solutions, but that&amp;rsquo;s also naive of me — there are no easy answers to dismantling the effects of systemic racism and the dehumanizing vitriol teens encounter online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read maybe ten pages in &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; in the last few weeks. I am really enjoying it and want to read on, but it&amp;rsquo;s been impossible to find the time and energy for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still watching &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt;; I&amp;rsquo;m practically done with it now. The later seasons aren&amp;rsquo;t as bad as I remember, but they have nothing on the Agrestic seasons. They not &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but they&amp;rsquo;re watchable, and that&amp;rsquo;s enough for me right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I watched &lt;em&gt;Survivor 42&lt;/em&gt; and are in the middle of &lt;em&gt;46&lt;/em&gt; as part of our prep for &lt;em&gt;Survivor 50&lt;/em&gt;. I liked &lt;em&gt;42&lt;/em&gt; more than I expected (Dreya is Queen); &lt;em&gt;46&lt;/em&gt; is a rewatch for me, but a good one — I love a season with goofy chaos like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I also spent Halloween re-watching &lt;em&gt;Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt;, though we both fell asleep somewhere around the Council of Elrond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve played a few more hours of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/em&gt; over the last few weeks. I&amp;rsquo;m still positive on it, but I&amp;rsquo;m missing the diversity of &lt;em&gt;Tactics Advance&lt;/em&gt; — I liked having the different races in my clan, but &lt;em&gt;Tactics&lt;/em&gt; seems limited to just humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;em&gt;Sound &amp;amp; Color&lt;/em&gt; by Alabama Shakes on a friend&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. Surprisingly, I was able to place &amp;ldquo;This Feeling&amp;rdquo; from hearing it on &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;; otherwise, I found the album a little too coffee shop jam band to care much about it. I liked &amp;ldquo;Drive By Baby,&amp;rdquo; though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The re-release of Mac Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;GO:OD AM&lt;/em&gt; dropped for real this time, so I listened to those three bonus tracks. I&amp;rsquo;d been listening to the leaked version of &amp;ldquo;Carpe Diem&amp;rdquo; for years at this point, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad to at last have that out officially. It&amp;rsquo;s a goofy song that I have a lot of affection for, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it (or the other two bonus tracks, which I think are bad) really fit tacked onto the end of &lt;em&gt;GO:OD AM&lt;/em&gt; — the album has such an intentional build and ending, and then it&amp;rsquo;s surprise! Here are two songs that probably didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be released and one that could have been on a leaks EP or something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a time in my life when I was listening to all the Mac leaks and keeping up as more dropped, but nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted all of them save for a few I really care about. Part of that has been enabled by the family &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS7rnvWOJrE&#34;&gt;releasing official versions of some that I do really like, of course&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m just holding on in hopes that the five or so&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that I hang onto drop officially. This is unlikely, however, because one of them was on the leaked &lt;em&gt;Balloonerism&lt;/em&gt; but didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the official release. There&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;ldquo;The Sun Room&amp;rdquo; (which eventually just became &amp;ldquo;The Star Room&amp;rdquo;), which probably would have been included on the re-release of &lt;em&gt;WMWTSO&lt;/em&gt; if it was going to be anywhere. Consider this my requiem for an official drop of &amp;ldquo;Pure,&amp;rdquo; I guess, and then I can move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d give links to them but they pop up and then get copyright striked pretty quickly — and also they&amp;rsquo;re inherently controversial. Clearly I have some mixed feelings on them.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;This week has been &lt;em&gt;rough&lt;/em&gt;. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/033/&#34;&gt;I wrote last week&lt;/a&gt;, I was out sick from work three days, so all this week I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing catch up — trying to dig myself out of the hole while also keeping head above water with everything new that&amp;rsquo;s happening&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The group of kids I have this year are really likeable, but they&amp;rsquo;re incredibly immature. I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with a lot of classroom management challenges, which has rarely been an issue for me&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to keep them in their seats and have a coherent lesson without interruptions. One class in particular is incredibly challenging and it&amp;rsquo;s really starting to wear on me. I love what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, in a general sense, but lately, I&amp;rsquo;m not happy to go to work. I dread the middle portion of my day in particular (tough class and then immediately into lunch duty). The highlights have been few and far between; I&amp;rsquo;m constantly disappointed in myself that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing a better job even though I know a lot of these struggles are bigger than me and my classroom. On top of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bunch of not fun expenses crop up this week — a $2500 repair bill on my car, we had our septic tank pumped, and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get a plumber in because our shower drain isn&amp;rsquo;t draining — and other adult shit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. All in, this week has been filled with an overwhelming number of stressors piling together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did have a bit of a breakthrough with my college class, however. It&amp;rsquo;s been going well for weeks now, but this week&amp;rsquo;s class in particular felt like I was finally an authentic version of myself as a teacher (albeit to an older audience than I&amp;rsquo;m used to) rather than trying to be the professor I took the class with (now a friend and mentor). I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve at last released myself from lofty expectations, perfectionism and trying to squash myself into a mold and just be &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, I still have the nagging voice that says that I&amp;rsquo;m not good enough or doing enough, but perhaps drowning that out is the next frontier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We did creative non-fiction writing this week in the class (inspired by &lt;em&gt;Mango Street&lt;/em&gt;), which is my favorite genre to write, and it has me thinking about the personal writing I&amp;rsquo;ve done. I&amp;rsquo;ve always considered it unpublishable and unworthy to be shared even with friends (especially with friends?), but I simultaneously feel compelled to push myself out of that comfort zone and pursue it more seriously. It&amp;rsquo;s fucking personal, though, and scary to submit myself to the mortifying ordeal of being known — but then again, this is my blog, and if I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to publish it here, the words will forever rot and die on my hard drive,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which feels a cruel fate to subject them to, not the least because I&amp;rsquo;ve labored so much over them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.lol/@cass/115275010398353612&#34;&gt;posted on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; that I think I&amp;rsquo;m about to get into fountain pens. Maybe a year ago, I got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pen-Black-02-Extra-Fine/pd/24020&#34;&gt;Platinum Preppy EF&lt;/a&gt; in a JetPens starter pack. I&amp;rsquo;d never used a fountain pen before, and when I tried it out, I found it really unpleasant to write with and stuffed it in a desk drawer. A few months ago, though, some students who are into calligraphy and bujo came to talk to me about pens, and I pulled it out to show them — and I found I loved writing with it. It ran out of ink recently, so I decided to do a little research on fountain pens and ordered a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-SWIPE-Smoke-Fountain-Pen-Extra-Fine/pd/32576&#34;&gt;TSWBI Swipe&lt;/a&gt;, a couple cartridges, and a syringe. It finally came in today and I found the line &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too thick — I have small handwriting and generally use .03 gel pens. The Preppy felt good to me — a little thicker but not unreasonable — so I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed. I&amp;rsquo;ve only tried the Swipe on shitty copy paper so far and will give it a go on better quality stock, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking now of ordering a converter and bottled ink to use with the Preppy. It&amp;rsquo;s such a complicated world to dive into, though! If there are fountain pen people out there reading this, I appreciate any guidance!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still technically reading &lt;em&gt;Villette,&lt;/em&gt; a few pages at a time; this time, it&amp;rsquo;s less an indictment of the text and more how fucking busy I&amp;rsquo;ve been. I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely enjoying it (and excessively entertained by Lucy&amp;rsquo;s homoerotic fascination with Madame Beck) and dying to go back to it, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to make time for reading this week. I&amp;rsquo;m so exhausted by the time I get home and eat dinner that I can&amp;rsquo;t mentally commit to reading — and forget finding time during the school day like I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still rewatching &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt; and my feelings are mostly unchanged: I&amp;rsquo;m here for Nancy and Mary Louise Parker&amp;rsquo;s performance. I&amp;rsquo;m into the Ren-Mar season now, where Esteban is introduced and looms large; I remember this being when I started to turn on the show when I watched it the first time, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I begin to wane on it again or if my feelings about him change (they have not yet — I find his mafia boss shit weird and gross even if it&amp;rsquo;s a natural character progression for Nancy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/em&gt; remaster against my better judgement (not really — I&amp;rsquo;d just hoped to have finished &lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&lt;/em&gt; at this point). I was a huge fan of &lt;em&gt;Tactics Advance&lt;/em&gt; as a kid and was always curious about &lt;em&gt;Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, but rumors have swelled for years about a potential remaster, so I always put off playing it until the remaster dropped. I&amp;rsquo;m only in Chapter 2, but I really love it so far; it&amp;rsquo;s the fluid and customizable job system that I loved from &lt;em&gt;Tactics Advance&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in the story than I anticipated. I&amp;rsquo;ve always heard that it&amp;rsquo;s super political, which it is, but there&amp;rsquo;s enough of a human angle in the relationship with Ramza and Delita that I find it compelling and am excited to see what happens next. I&amp;rsquo;d like to say I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find time during the coming week to play it more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;em&gt;Food in the Belly&lt;/em&gt; by Xavier Rudd because &amp;ldquo;Messages&amp;rdquo; was in an episode of &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt;. I found the album mostly forgettable outside of the one song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kitty put out a new song (&lt;a href=&#34;https://kitty.bandcamp.com/track/cassadaga-fairy-garden&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;cassadaga fairy garden&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) that I think is really cool. It feels like D&amp;amp;B track fused with BOPPLES and Ninajirachi. I really dug &lt;a href=&#34;https://kitty.bandcamp.com/track/international-thirst-championship&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;international thirst champion,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; too, which came out earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I&amp;rsquo;m going back to Future&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Red Leather&amp;rdquo; a lot this week. I think it was in a dream I had, and it&amp;rsquo;s been caught in my head ever since. I love a guitar in a rap song, I think (see also: Polo G&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Martin &amp;amp; Gina&amp;rdquo; and Raury&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Amor&amp;rdquo; — the outro, at least).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to maybe start including my top ten songs every week in a kind of playlist feature here? Bandcamp launched a playlist feature&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that I could use, but it could also just be a list. Right now remote access to my Plex server is being weird and my plays haven&amp;rsquo;t been scrobbling properly unless I&amp;rsquo;m on my home network&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m working off of just the Plex stats, which seem wrong. Regardless, here&amp;rsquo;s what I have for this week — a mix of most played and songs I&amp;rsquo;m just thinking about, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Red Leather&amp;rdquo; by Future&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;cassadaga fairy garden&amp;rdquo; by Kitty&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amor&amp;rdquo; by Raury&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sickset&amp;rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;She Crows (Documented Minor Emotional Breakdown #4)&amp;rdquo; by Los Campesinos!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tin Man&amp;rdquo; by feeble little horse&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Messages&amp;rdquo; by Xavier Rudd&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Called: Freefall&amp;rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cold Love&amp;rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Love the Valley&amp;rdquo; by Ten in the Swear Jar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fuck Spotify so I&amp;rsquo;m not making the playlists there, but I guess you can make your own, if you&amp;rsquo;re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m mixing my metaphors here and I don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose this means that I have good classroom management, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really thought of it that way — I am myself and do what feels natural, which has always worked for me&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;navigating in-law relationships and private things I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to be writing about on my little fucking blog&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;of course I have cloud backups because I&amp;rsquo;m not irresponsible but you get my point&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;mobile-only for now, which is a non-starter for me, but hopefully the web editor will launch soon&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve contacted my ISP to hopefully try to resolve this — I&amp;rsquo;m caught behind double NAT&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I missed a week, so consider this two weeks of week notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was dead sick this week; I missed three days of work to some kind of upper respiratory illness that&amp;rsquo;s going around the school. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been sick in months, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a part of it, but this genuinely kicked me on my ass, and my mom ingrained workaholic tendencies in me so severe that I feel guilty taking sick days. Alas, I am continuously humbled by the reality of existing in a human body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That sickness (and catching up on everything I missed in three days out) consumed the majority of my time and focus through the week. I did however finally buy a basketball, which is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about doing for a while now. I played a lot as a kid and had an urge to get back into playing. I&amp;rsquo;m consistently running in a nearby park with a friend on Sunday mornings, and I am thinking of shooting some hoops afterward. I gave that its first test today and played for nearly two hours with my running buddy&amp;rsquo;s daughter. I am unfortunately quite bad, but for my first time holding a ball in 20 years, I&amp;rsquo;m content to accept that I&amp;rsquo;m simply out of practice.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week I fretted about my glasses. I am here to report that they do actually really help — especially for working on the computer — but that I am still a big baby about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading &lt;em&gt;Accountable: The True Story of a Racist Social Media Account and the Teenagers Whose Lives It Changed&lt;/em&gt; by Dashka Slater for a school book club. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through and enjoying it; it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty quick, easy read, but it&amp;rsquo;s highly relevant to our students today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For personal reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve picked &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; by Charlotte Brontë back up. I started from the beginning (I made it maybe 20 pages in last time) and am now about 75 pages deep. I think the very beginning in Bretton was hard to trudge through, but Lucy has now arrived in Villette and there&amp;rsquo;s more promise there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my sickness, I burned through the remainder of &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;. I enjoyed the last season or two more than I expected and am glad to have finally finished the show. I watched the entire first movie and a chunk of the second; I found them awful and do not intend to finish them unless I am quite desperate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After quitting &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;, I was somehow struck with the urge to rewatch &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt; for maybe the fourth time. I&amp;rsquo;m in the third season right now and enjoying it, but I recall everything after season three being bad. I still find Andy and Doug insufferable and deeply problematic, but I adore Mary Louise Parker&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of Nancy and watching her descent into megalomania.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe has started playing &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix&lt;/em&gt; with me watching. I have a lot of fondness for the game (and history that I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly made my peace with). I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched &lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&lt;/em&gt; in a few weeks now, which is equal parts being busy with school and not feeling compelled to go back to it. I would like to finish it, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited for (and preordered) the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/em&gt; remaster that releases in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student told me to listen to Tyler The Creator. I&amp;rsquo;ve never listened to his music in any substantial capacity but have always felt I&amp;rsquo;ve known enough through word of mouth to know I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy him. Still, I emotionally blackmailed myself into believing that I needed to honor my students&amp;rsquo; voices and listened through to &lt;em&gt;Call Me If You Get Lost&lt;/em&gt;. I did not hate it as I expected but also feel no need to listen to any of it ever again. &amp;ldquo;Wilshire&amp;rdquo; was the only track I found somewhat compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s been mostly shuffles for me. I briefly reawakened my &amp;ldquo;Moody Orange&amp;rdquo; hyperfixation and am determined to learn all of the lyrics (I&amp;rsquo;m close!), but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find much time for music lately with the hubbub of school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I was never good.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;This was the first full week of school, so naturally that consumed most of my time. Things are going well enough so far; I have one class that&amp;rsquo;s really challenging, but the rest are smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw an optometrist for the first time in my life this week; I noticed last year that I was having trouble seeing the board at the front of my classroom toward the end of the day. I thought it might just be fatigue, but Joe encouraged me to make an appointment even so considering I&amp;rsquo;ve never been. Apparently I have crossed a new threshold of old age and now need readers. I&amp;rsquo;ve insisted for years that I want glasses, that I feel they suit my face and personality, but the moment the doctor asked me &amp;ldquo;Do you want someone to help you pick out glasses today?&amp;rdquo; I was immediately confronted with my hubris and regretted all previous comments. The pair I ordered haven&amp;rsquo;t come in yet, so expect a further meltdown next week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the computer nerd front, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.getmailspring.com/&#34;&gt;Mailspring&lt;/a&gt; in lieu of Thunderbird (which is great, but the interface is clunky and ugly and I am a fundamentally vain person), and I subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/sync&#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/a&gt; for my vaults with work notes and my (non-blog, creative, unpublishable) writing. Obsidian offers a remarkably generous educator discount (40%). I&amp;rsquo;ve also taken my first foray into Soulseek, for which I&amp;rsquo;m about thirty years late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I had a long conversation this week about some serious shit that isn&amp;rsquo;t really appropriate to write about my little fucking blog, but the bit I do feel comfortable sharing here is my lifelong obsession with death and dying — not in a macabre true crime bullshit way, but in a perhaps obsessive and compulsive anxiety about my impending death and the ones of those I love. He has encouraged therapy; I said I would consider it for his sake. I believe he then encouraged me to also work on my lack of self-worth in therapy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My volleyball rec league started back up, so I now have that and my Sunday morning runs as regular routines. I&amp;rsquo;m running a 5K in early November and feel more than prepared, endurance-wise (the Sunday runs are five to six miles), but I&amp;rsquo;d really like to push myself to improve on speed before it rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;All Boys Aren&amp;rsquo;t Blue&lt;/em&gt; by George M. Johnson at last. I think I need a break from young adult literature for a while — &lt;em&gt;Perdido Street Station&lt;/em&gt; was next on my list, but a student teased me about never having finished &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to give it another shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve kept on with &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt; on and off; it&amp;rsquo;s become my folding laundry show.

It&amp;rsquo;s remained entertaining, though I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider any of it &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; in an objective sense beyond the first season. I think there are a few storylines that are completely misguided and borderline intolerable (Bates and Anna, mostly, and Prince Kuragin), but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been compelled to &lt;em&gt;stop watching&lt;/em&gt;, which indicates something — if only my low standards for what I consume whilst folding underwear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plex had a data breach that meant I had to change my password and do some reauthentication that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to until the weekend, so I streamed a lot of music off the Bandcamp app when away from home — primarily &lt;em&gt;EELS&lt;/em&gt; by Being Dead, which I &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/025/&#34;&gt;first mentioned back in July&lt;/a&gt; and remain a great fan of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A student of mine recommended that I listen to Tyler, The Creator, which I now feel obligated to do, though I think I know what the end result will be. He gave me three albums, and I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with &lt;em&gt;CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST&lt;/em&gt;. More to come on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also ripped a better quality version of &lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip; A Better View of the Rising Moon&lt;/em&gt; by 1997, an album I really liked when I was 12, so I&amp;rsquo;m listening through that for the first time in probably over a decade. No detailed thoughts at the moment, and any that I could offer would be undoubtedly clouded by nostalgia. My best sweeping generalization is that it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad album, but it&amp;rsquo;s dated and kind of for children, which I no longer am. I need readers, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

These two were the most involved because they were long and involved creating some new shortcodes (particularly the games one).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/my-top-ten-video-games-from-the-2010s/&#34;&gt;My Top Ten Video Games from the 2010s&lt;/a&gt; (2019-11-13)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/my-top-ten-albums-from-the-2010s&#34;&gt;My Top Ten Albums from the 2010s&lt;/a&gt; (2019-12-20)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve therefore cancelled my Digital Ocean droplet&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and can stop worrying about keeping a WordPress install up to date. All links to bansheebeat.org should now redirect here. I still love the the domain name and might look for something fun to do with it one day.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, school started back up this week, so that&amp;rsquo;s been consuming my time. We&amp;rsquo;re only doing operations and procedures right now, but so far, things are going alright. I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic it&amp;rsquo;ll stay that way. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a step back from some of my committees and other obligations because I&amp;rsquo;m adjuncting this semester. Despite the first day of school craze, it&amp;rsquo;s odd how &lt;em&gt;relaxed&lt;/em&gt; everything feels without the extra responsibilities that I typically heap upon myself. And I&amp;rsquo;m confident in my teaching! I have been for a long time, but this year more than ever. It&amp;rsquo;s a welcome reprieve from the horrific imposter syndrome I&amp;rsquo;ve felt around my college class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At home and at my behest, we have been eating dinner at the dinner table. The entire time Joe and I have been living together, we&amp;rsquo;ve eaten on the couch while watching TV (unless we had company). Now that we&amp;rsquo;re back at work, I want to spend actual, engaged time with each other in what time we have. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it will stick, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know that it will be every night, but I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m typing these notes hastily on Sunday night as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good about assembling them through the week. I have this odd sensation that I had some kind of monumental accomplishment or life event occur this week, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember what it was. I&amp;rsquo;ll settle for believing that it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of illusion, as I&amp;rsquo;d remember anything as important. Or, perhaps, it can be held for next week. All around, though, being back at work feels like being back with myself — a version of myself that is living deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I finished watching &lt;em&gt;Survivor: Blood vs. Water&lt;/em&gt;. We burned through &lt;em&gt;Millennials vs. Gen X&lt;/em&gt; after that and are now on &lt;em&gt;Cagayan&lt;/em&gt;. I like &lt;em&gt;Cagayan&lt;/em&gt; less than I remember it, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to watch for other seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Joe&amp;rsquo;s behest, we also watched &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt; (2000). &lt;a href=&#34;https://mediaclub.plus/&#34;&gt;Media Club Plus&lt;/a&gt; is apparently covering all of the M. Night Shyamalan movies; Joe wants to listen, but he&amp;rsquo;s never seen any of the films. He watched &lt;em&gt;Sixth Sense&lt;/em&gt; alone (I&amp;rsquo;d already seen it years ago and remember liking it), but he roped me into &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt;, which I watched without knowing anything about. I think it was some of the worst bullshit I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, and I&amp;rsquo;ve informed him that he will be watching all the rest of the movies on his own. Somehow, &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt; is considered one of Shyamalan&amp;rsquo;s best movies (behind &lt;em&gt;Sixth Sense&lt;/em&gt;, obviously). If that&amp;rsquo;s the best, I have no interest in putting myself through any more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student taught me to play Gin, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she was mixed up on the rules.

I went through all of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one&amp;rsquo;s coming for us&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (listen to &amp;ldquo;Sadness,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Cut me out,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Unwieldy Foam&amp;rdquo;), and I&amp;rsquo;ve kept on with &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Let Them Begin&lt;/em&gt; from last week (really feeling &amp;ldquo;The Coolest Guy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Seance&amp;rdquo;). There&amp;rsquo;s a kind of mopey indie slacker rock vibe to a lot of these, which I suppose reflects how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebethsnz.bandcamp.com/album/straight-line-was-a-lie&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Straight Line Was a Lie&lt;/em&gt; by The Beths&lt;/a&gt; (and bought it on Bandcamp Friday). It was OK — I loved &amp;ldquo;No Joy,&amp;rdquo; but I found the rest unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kept&lt;/em&gt; definitely benefited from recency bias; I was super into it when I wrote this post. I&amp;rsquo;d move &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; up higher on the list today, but I think the intention of the post is to capture how I felt in that moment of time — not necessarily to create a perennial representation of my tastes.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now $5/mo richer.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something with music would be fitting. Maybe if I spin off a section of this site for album ratings? I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to start a database to track my listening&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;d also rather have everything on one domain.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;First up, a small update to my week notes format: I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to include a cover image with each post as a further homage to &lt;em&gt;Never Hungover Again&lt;/em&gt; (from which I shamelessly stole the design of my site). I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it a random picture from the week. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this will encourage me to take more pictures, perhaps even using the fancy camera that I paid several hundred dollars for and never touch. I took this week&amp;rsquo;s picture in the bathroom of a winery (omitted snapchat caption: &amp;ldquo;wasn&amp;rsquo;t considering it but thanks for the heads up i guess&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I taught my first college class! It went far better than I anticipated; by about half an hour in, I fell into my natural teacher mode and it was smooth sailing from there. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to work with the kids&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and see how I do throughout the semester. I still have deep-seated imposter syndrome about teaching (&lt;em&gt;adjunct lecturing&lt;/em&gt;) the course on a macro-level, but the day-by-day is at least seeming more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For context,  the college I&amp;rsquo;m teaching (&lt;em&gt;adjunct lecturing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) at is my alma mater. I transferred there as a junior from community college, and this course is the first one I took there — with a professor who went on to become a mentor and a personal friend. She scared the shit out of me then (she still does) because she is &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt; at what she does, so experienced, and (seemingly) effortlessly incredible as a teacher. The idea that I have to, in some way, fill her shoes — teach her class, in the same room I took it, nine years later — is absolutely terrifying. Who am I to tell these kids how to teach?? I have very lovely friends who have talked me up and assured me that I&amp;rsquo;ll do a great job, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to shake the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing what she would have (or not doing as good as her). Of course that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous and I need to be my own person, and it is within this contradiction that I must exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to my classroom a few times this week getting some of the bigger projects done. I&amp;rsquo;ll have time to put on finishing touches on the teacher conference days next week, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather cut open 96 tennis balls at a relaxed pace than rush to do it the day before kids show up. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been spending time helping Joe get his together, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Site-wise, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to backport content from an old blog.

I finally decided to install some mods so that I can just finish the game. I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12023&#34;&gt;Cheaters Spell Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to basically pass all of my dice checks and then something to increase my carry capacity. Nothing game-breaking necessarily since I was already save-scumming every roll — instead, hopefully, I&amp;rsquo;m just saving myself &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. It took a while to figure out how to make the mods work,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mostly because the developer of the (good, but esoteric and inscrutable) mod manager has no publicly accessible documentation or help; it&amp;rsquo;s all in a fucking Discord server.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing not so much on exploring Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate the city naturally and rather just mainlining toward my quest markers on the map. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped up Gale&amp;rsquo;s quest as far as I can until much later in the game — why I chose to start with his, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Proximity, I guess. I did however encounter a friend of Karlach&amp;rsquo;s (with Karlach in the party), who asked if Karlach and I were an item. Karlach responded with &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vsPvlDl5ksg?si=9sZA_GX3z5ykGiXg&amp;amp;t=16&#34;&gt;something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;gross.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Salt in the wound etc. I finished the Auntie Ethel plotline and picked up Minsc; I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel better about the game — things are much smoother when I&amp;rsquo;m passing most every dice roll. Importantly, this is only on my character, so while she has a bit of an advantage on attacks in battle (nothing crazy though because she&amp;rsquo;s mainly a healer), there&amp;rsquo;s still a challenge. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m back to my Act I adulation, but I&amp;rsquo;m at least feeling more motivated to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of podcast listening this week! Cleaning and organizing my classroom has been a good opportunity for it because it&amp;rsquo;s mostly mindless labor. I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging through Into the Aether&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; episodes (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pca.st/ryz2z5wd&#34;&gt;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep | Bonus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pca.st/m4xgagit&#34;&gt;I Norted Myself&lt;/a&gt;) plus the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pca.st/Kj2p&#34;&gt;Song Exploder episode on &amp;ldquo;Miasma Sky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebugclub.bandcamp.com/album/pure-particles&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pure Particles&lt;/em&gt; by The Bug Club&lt;/a&gt;. It has some of my favorite songs of theirs (&amp;ldquo;If My Mother Thinks I&amp;rsquo;m Happy,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Pure Particles,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;A Love Song,&amp;rdquo; primarily). I haven&amp;rsquo;t been quite as enthused with their more recent releases — &lt;em&gt;Very Human Features&lt;/em&gt; was good, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care about &lt;em&gt;On the Intricate Inner Workings of the System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — but &lt;em&gt;Pure Particles&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;Rare Birds&lt;/em&gt; is such an incredible run of quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of my mission to upgrade the low quality MP3s I have on my music server, I ordered and ripped a few CDs this week: Johnny Flynn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;A Larum&lt;/em&gt;, Mirah&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;C&amp;rsquo;mon Miracle&lt;/em&gt;, and Freelance Whales&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Weathervanes&lt;/em&gt;. I was really only looking for &lt;em&gt;A Larum&lt;/em&gt; specifically, but the seller on discogs had a shipping minimum. The others were on my list and the seller happened to have them available. It&amp;rsquo;s a little funny — I was listening to these albums all at a specific point in my life (specifically &lt;em&gt;C&amp;rsquo;mon Miracle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Weathervanes&lt;/em&gt; when I was horrifically depressed in my late teens; Johnny Flynn was a bit earlier).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That nostalgia (if you can call it that — is there a nostalgia that&amp;rsquo;s for &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; memories?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) brought me back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aveytare.bandcamp.com/album/pullhair-rubeye&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pullhair Rubeye&lt;/em&gt; by Avey Tare &amp;amp; Kría Brekkan&lt;/a&gt;, an odd album that was released in reverse. The reversed version (so the normal one) of &amp;ldquo;Lay Lay Off, Faselam&amp;rdquo; is an all-timer for me; I was listening to it a lot in 2012. Releasing the album in reverse was, apparently, a controversial move, but I like it both ways — and I finally took the time to actually reverse it myself.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/album/dont-let-them-begin-ep&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Let Them Begin&lt;/em&gt; by Trust Fund&lt;/a&gt; because I had &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll Both Apologize&amp;rdquo; stuck in my head (🎶 &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m alone in the house and I&amp;rsquo;m freaking myself out again, I&amp;rsquo;m clapping my hands and spinning my arms around&lt;/em&gt; 🎶). It&amp;rsquo;s good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself referring to the students as &amp;ldquo;kids.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;re juniors and seniors in college, so probably at most around ten years younger than me. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is a speech pattern picked up from teaching middle schoolers, who I can safely call kids, or if I&amp;rsquo;m an old lady now. More on that later.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gag entertains me and I will continue it all semester.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for anyone reading this and encountering issues with the BG3 Mod Manager not showing a campaign, make sure you download BG3MM &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager&#34;&gt;straight from the creator&amp;rsquo;s Github repo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like Discord well enough and use it a lot, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to join your shitty Discord server just to search for other people with the same problem as me.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The exception is &amp;ldquo;Have U Ever Been 2 Wales,&amp;rdquo; which is an all-timer.

Here are the posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved over:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/revolutions&#34;&gt;Revolutions&lt;/a&gt; (2015-03-12)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/life-is-strange-episode-1-chrysalis&#34;&gt;Life is Strange Episode 1: Chrysalis&lt;/a&gt; (2015-02-05)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/house-of-leaves-appendix-ii-e-the-three-attic-whalestoe-institute-letters-may-8th-1987/&#34;&gt;House of Leaves: Appendix II-E, The Three Attic Whalestoe Institute Letters (May 8th, 1987)&lt;/a&gt; (2015-01-01)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/canopies-and-drapes/&#34;&gt;Canopies and Drapes: Emmy the Great’s Twist on the Classic Breakup Song&lt;/a&gt; (2014-11-09)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/princess-bubblegum-marceline-still-just-almost-girlfriends/&#34;&gt;Princess Bubblegum &amp;amp; Marceline: Still Just Almost Girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; (2014-08-14)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for unintentional pings on my rss feed; also, be aware that a lot of these are very old (like, ten years) and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily reflect who I am as a person today! I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be better about preserving and sharing my writing, so I suppose that means I must submit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/i-know-what-you-think-of-me/&#34;&gt;the mortifying ordeal of being known&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these pieces, while flawed, I am still fond of — particularly the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; one. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to do more and eventually close down the blog where they originally appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve continued my desk journey from last week, by which I mean I abandoned the Ergotron arm and ordered a Pixio PS1D instead. The Pixio arm feels cheaper in places, but the clamp is of reasonable size, and on the whole, it was &lt;em&gt;leagues&lt;/em&gt; easier to set up than the Ergotron arm. The Ergotron comes pre-assembled, it&amp;rsquo;s heavy, and you have to affix the monitors directly to the arms. The Pixio went together in pieces (with decent directions), which made it entirely feasible to do on one&amp;rsquo;s own. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to climb under your desk to clamp it down! There are detachable VESA plates so you can just slide your monitors right on! The clamp is a reasonable size! I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out final positioning for the monitors themselves, but I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with how much it&amp;rsquo;s cleaned up my desk setup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/08/desk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image showing a desk with monitors on an arm. It is very clean and cute.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This whole process was stressful, but the Pixio enabled me to use the steel plates I&amp;rsquo;d ordered, so I no longer have fears of my monitors crashing down on me one day. All&amp;rsquo;s well that ends, I suppose.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week, I was on a podcast!&lt;/strong&gt; I talked on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pca.st/002pdgai&#34;&gt;The Worst Community Report&lt;/a&gt; with TK &amp;amp; co. about blogging and the indie web.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Being on this makes me miss podcasting even more than I already had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Joe and I went to a wedding (fine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). On Sunday, a friend of mine and I started what we hope to be a weekly habit, which is an early morning long run. We did five miles today, and I think we want to work up to doing 10K distances (which I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat comfortable with, but this was only her second time going further than a 5K). Our pace is fairly slow, but I want to work on endurance more than pace — and we talk pretty much the whole time. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to have an accountability partner, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t run much this summer, and to have scheduled time with her.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I also went to a coworker&amp;rsquo;s 40th birthday party (also fine). Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m just stressed about my college class, which starts tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t read much this week in terms of actual books, but I did feel challenged (in a good way) by &lt;a href=&#34;https://talk.jackalope.city/talk/stop-valorizing-introversion/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop Valorizing Introversion&amp;rdquo; on jackalope.city&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The response I hear, often, to this is: “Friendships shouldn’t be work!” Wrong. Anything worth having is work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wonder at this resistance to considering relationships worth the work.&#xA;All of the strongest typical relationship types in United States society are characterized by work: The parents who dedicate their lives to raising a child, the domestic partnership and give-and-take of a spousal or domestic partnership arrangement, the best friend who always drives you to the airport, and even the necessary relationship of care you have with your pets. The work you put into the relationship is not the cost of the relationship. The work &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I consider myself an introvert and it is hard to make friends as an adult, but I have more friends — and friends who I see often and make an effort to spend time with — now as an adult than I ever have in my life. I think, like with other kinds of work, it gets easier as you do it more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I are almost done with &lt;em&gt;Survivor: Caramoan&lt;/em&gt;, and we&amp;rsquo;re keeping up with Austin Walker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&lt;/em&gt; Let&amp;rsquo;s Play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still playing &lt;em&gt;Fields of Mistria&lt;/em&gt;, although I have had a few mid-day game crashes this week. The game is in early access, so I can&amp;rsquo;t complain too much, but it&amp;rsquo;s the first time it&amp;rsquo;s happened to me. It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to lose progress, but I suppose I should get into the habit of saving a few times throughout the day.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I looked around the game&amp;rsquo;s subreddit and it seems to be an issue for a lot of folks after the latest update, so maybe I just need to wait until they roll out a patch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also played a little bit more of &lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m still very frustrated with it and kind of want to just be done. It&amp;rsquo;s a bummer because I was really in love with the game in Act I and parts of Act II. I was excited for Act III because actually reaching Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate the place seemed thrilling — there are many story threads intersecting there! But practically, this means I&amp;rsquo;m walking ten feet into the city to trigger a scene for one companion&amp;rsquo;s quest then switching in another companion for their scene. I&amp;rsquo;m still save-scumming constantly, which means I&amp;rsquo;m spending a hell of a lot of time staring at loading screens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the combat in the game at one point, but I did the fight with Lorroakan this week and tried to cast Silence on him to stop Elemental Retort. For no explicable reason, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work — despite it being a spell that he says &lt;em&gt;out loud&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a bug or an oversight, but I never feel like the abilities and spells that negate or create conditions ever work for me. It seems like most fights can be won by just brute-forcing. I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do that, but when I try to be tactical and clever, it so rarely works out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know I should probably just take a break from the game and come back to it one day, but I know I&amp;rsquo;ll forget what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the story if I leave it for too long. I think I just need to finish it, but I&amp;rsquo;m not having fun while playing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&#34;hutchharris.bandcamp.com/album/suck-up-all-the-oxygen&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUCK UP ALL THE OXYGEN&lt;/em&gt; by Hutch Harris&lt;/a&gt; because I saw the cover on Bandcamp and thought it was funny. The album was fine but not for me. There was a time in my life when I probably would have been really into this, but it&amp;rsquo;s not now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I picked up my &lt;em&gt;All We Know is Falling&lt;/em&gt; listen from last week, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Never Let This Go - a nice build and pleasant to listen to, but it blends in with a lot of the rest of the album (yet fails to stand out).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whoa - I always loved this one; great energy that lets me overlook the silly lyrics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Conspiracy - forgettable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Franklin - I was so surprised by how fond of this song I still am. It&amp;rsquo;s sweet; the backing vocals are a bit distracting — I&amp;rsquo;d rather they were just Hayley, but I understand that they were going for a duet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My Heart - I was listening to a decent rip of this album but this song still somehow sounds like a super compressed 96kbps MP3. The screaming in this song is also so atonal — it feels like a studio note given what was &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; at the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oh Star - another forgettable one for me; I don&amp;rsquo;t really like slow songs in general I think and especially not when Paramore does them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://underscores.bandcamp.com/album/fishmonger&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fishmonger&lt;/em&gt; by underscores&lt;/a&gt;. I really love this album (still). I love just about every song on it, but &amp;ldquo;Del mar county fair (2008)&amp;rdquo; is hitting for me in particular lately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Podcast-wise, I listened to the first episode of &lt;a href=&#34;https://leavingtheparty.blog/2025/08/15/podcast-lovely-lady-rpg-2024/&#34;&gt;Leaving the Party&lt;/a&gt;, mostly while mowing my lawn. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d ever come across &lt;em&gt;Lovely Lady RPG&lt;/em&gt; in my normal travels — visual novels have never held appeal for me — so it&amp;rsquo;s cool to have a show introduce me to games and a perspective that are not ordinarily in my milieu. I also really enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavelengths.online/posts/aj-fillari-on-podcasting-media-crit-and-the-last-of-us-online&#34;&gt;this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of Wavelengths&lt;/a&gt;, where Brendon Bigley and AJ Fillari talked about, well, talking. It was a great listen and, again, made me really want to go back to podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still have the Ergotron arm. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to sell it locally on Facebook Marketplace to get some of my money back, so things aren&amp;rsquo;t over just yet.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It feels very cool and meta to now talk about this on my blog.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t drink and I don&amp;rsquo;t (generally) dance (are the two related? discuss), so weddings are a dull affair for me.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I genuinely adore this friend and love talking to her.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mistria&lt;/em&gt; gives you this option; &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; does not&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a mid-day crash in &lt;em&gt;Stardew.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

The monitor mount I bought has a really small clamp, which I should have checked before buying it, but I was so excited about a good deal. It fits on the desk and looks great, but I&amp;rsquo;m not able to spread the weight with the steel plates I bought, and I don&amp;rsquo;t trust a particleboard desktop to stand the test of time with a clamp. I spent a long time trying to brainstorm solutions (modify the clamp? build a wooden desk top?), and I had a sleepless night stressed about it. Eventually I decided to just order a different mount and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to sell this one locally to get my money back. It&amp;rsquo;s a bummer because the arm is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice, but I wanted the piece of mind of using something that isn&amp;rsquo;t jerry-rigged. Normally I&amp;rsquo;m down for a stupid solution, but not when it&amp;rsquo;s holding up several hundreds of dollars of tech.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I went to a PD on &lt;em&gt;The Writing Revolution,&lt;/em&gt; which was more of an excuse for me to hang with some colleagues that I like, and I finally finished the syllabus for the college course I&amp;rsquo;m teaching in a week or so. Joe and I then spent the weekend visiting some friends. It really feels like summer is winding down; I can see the start of the school year rush kicking up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of &lt;em&gt;All Boys Aren&amp;rsquo;t Blue,&lt;/em&gt; but I focused on finishing my syllabus instead of finishing the book this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I (re)watched &lt;em&gt;Sky High&lt;/em&gt;. It was on Disney Channel constantly when we were kids. I am proud to say that the movie still rocks. When visiting friends, we also watched &lt;em&gt;Cars&lt;/em&gt;, which I had somehow never seen. I liked it more than I expected to, though I thought some of the messaging was confused — don&amp;rsquo;t give me a diatribe about the road going &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; the land and driving for enjoyment when cars are one of the greatest environmental blights in our society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to listening to &lt;em&gt;SOPHIE&lt;/em&gt; by SOPHIE. Man, I have such mixed feelings about posthumous releases. The greedy bitch in me wants more, always, especially from artists who died way too young. I know SOPHIE&amp;rsquo;s brother, who finished the album, insists that SOPHIE was nearly done with it at the time of her death, but the stretch between &amp;ldquo;nearly finished&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;actually ready to release&amp;rdquo; can be miles long for an artist. I&amp;rsquo;m not an artist, by any means, of SOPHIE&amp;rsquo;s caliber, but a piece of writing for me can completely transform in the edit. Posthumous albums too often feel like an early sketch&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a pastiche of the auteur that are perhaps categorically incapable of capturing the genuine vision and artistry of the deceased. Unfortunately, this was the case for me with &lt;em&gt;SOPHIE&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Reason Why&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Live in My Truth&amp;rdquo; were standouts, but in general, it lacked the thrill and voice of SOPHIE (RIP).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://muizyu.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-or-something-to-die-for&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;nothing or something to die for&lt;/em&gt; by mui zyu&lt;/a&gt;. I had high hopes because I really like &amp;ldquo;donna like parasites&amp;rdquo; (I got a version of it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://fatherdaughterrecords.com/products/its-2025-and-wow-thats-unfortunate-but-well-get-thru-this-with-a-free-sampler-so-here-ya-go&#34;&gt;a free sample pack from the label&lt;/a&gt;), but I found the album as a whole to be rather dull. &amp;ldquo;donna&amp;rdquo; was my only standout. zyu did put out &lt;a href=&#34;https://muizyu.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-or-something-to-die-for-cantonese-tasting-menu&#34;&gt;a collection with a few of the songs translated into Cantonese&lt;/a&gt;, which features Emmy the Great (who I like) — a really cool idea that would be more novel if I was into the original tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I shifted to Joanna Newsom&amp;rsquo;s earliest release, &lt;em&gt;Walnut Whales&lt;/em&gt;; it&amp;rsquo;s a rough sketch of songs that would be realized later, but there&amp;rsquo;s something really interesting about them — I think I love &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRoOGYTGJc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Peach, Plumb, Pear&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; better than &lt;a href=&#34;https://joannanewsom.bandcamp.com/album/the-milk-eyed-mender&#34;&gt;the one that eventually appeared on &lt;em&gt;Milk-Eyed Mender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is, of course, iconic and still wonderful, but I love a synth). I really love &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOACtsrSsgo&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Erin&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; too, which never saw a re-recording outside of &lt;em&gt;Walnut Whales&lt;/em&gt;. I listened to a bunch of &lt;em&gt;Ys&lt;/em&gt; this week as well; it remains one of my favorite albums.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still super into &lt;em&gt;I Love My Computer&lt;/em&gt; by Ninajirachi. Brendon Bigley &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavelengths.online/posts/a-good-album-i-love-my-computer-by-ninajirachi&#34;&gt;wrote a great review of it&lt;/a&gt; on Wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I chatted with my sister about music a bit and we reminisced about Paramore — we were huge fans as teens as soon as &lt;em&gt;All We Know Is Falling&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; dropped. For some nostalgia, I went to listen through to the album again and do a little song-by-song write up, but only got through a few tracks. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll pick it up on my next week notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All We Know&lt;/strong&gt; - Fine; a heavy track (by Paramore standards) that sets the tone for the album but is otherwise not super notable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure&lt;/strong&gt; - iconic and excellent still. If I was trying to expose someone to the early pop-punk/emo scene, this is one of the first tracks I&amp;rsquo;d play them. Special shoutout to the version of the song that was on &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency&lt;/strong&gt; - I also still really like this song. Josh Farro is an ass but the guitar on this song smashes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brighter&lt;/strong&gt; - I recall being a diehard for this song as a teen; today, I find it a little fatiguing to listen to. That might be in the mix, and I really like the outro still, but it&amp;rsquo;s a notable downturn after the Pressure-Emergency one-two.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here We Go Again&lt;/strong&gt; - This one feels like a bit of a recall of the band&amp;rsquo;s funk roots. I still really love this song. I remember being a fan of an acoustic live performance someone had put on YouTube. Farro really did have an ear for a catchy guitar hook.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of trying to get back into listening to podcasts, too, I listened to Cyberpunk 2077 from &lt;a href=&#34;https://rss.com/podcasts/bgm-gems-pod&#34;&gt;BGM Gems&lt;/a&gt; - a little challenging to listen to because I&amp;rsquo;ve never played Cyberpunk nor listened to the soundtrack, but I really appreciate the conversations, and I think highlighting music in games and using it as a lens to discuss them is a rad concept for a show. Excited to hear more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/021/&#34;&gt;similar beef&lt;/a&gt; with Mac Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Circles&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Using Hugo to generate a podcast feed</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been podcasting on and off for over ten years now — all shows that I&amp;rsquo;ve since abandoned&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, either intentionally or due to time — but I&amp;rsquo;ve kept websites for them up and running for archival purposes. Originally, the sites were powered by WordPress and podcasting plugins (PowerPress and then Podlove). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to continue paying to host the sites nor maintain a WordPress install&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I could, of course, use one of the many podcast hosting services out there — but just like I believe in owning your own space on the internet, I believe you should own and control your podcast feed (and not have to pay a company $15/mo in perpetuity). I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; (which I then deploy with Cloudflare Pages) to generate the sites and feeds; I chose Hugo  because I understand how to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you could make this work with other static site generators. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://eleventy-plugin-podcaster.com/&#34;&gt;an 11ty plugin&lt;/a&gt; out there, for example, which is far more advanced than what I&amp;rsquo;ve set up. But I built this myself. It works. It does not require me to endlessly fiddle or update (unless I want to).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not going to cover hosting your audio files in this post. I offload mine to a storage zone on &lt;a href=&#34;https://bunny.net/&#34;&gt;Bunny&lt;/a&gt;; my podcasts are low traffic, so that costs me $12/yr. You could probably get away with using archive.org for free instead, as long as you can get a direct link to your mp3. I&amp;rsquo;m also not going to cover creating a theme for your podcast in this post. I made my own for both of my sites, but you can easily use a premade one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A podcast is, at its core, a collection of audio files served by an RSS feed. That feed provides information to podcast apps, like where to download an episode and how long it is. An SSG like Hugo, which is designed primarily for bloggers, works great for this because it already has an &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#custom-templates&#34;&gt;an embedded RSS template&lt;/a&gt; that it uses to syndicate your content. The only difference is that we&amp;rsquo;re going to set up the RSS feed to serve both text (your show notes) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; audio — as well as all the information that podcast apps need to surface your show. We&amp;rsquo;re going to work from Hugo&amp;rsquo;s RSS base template but inject &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390&#34;&gt;basic podcast tags&lt;/a&gt; as well as some additional ones for newer features like chapter support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-custom-feed-template&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#creating-a-custom-feed-template&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Creating a custom feed template&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, find your Hugo config file. I use &lt;code&gt;toml&lt;/code&gt; format, so mine is hugo.toml at the root of my site directory. I believe Hugo uses &lt;code&gt;toml&lt;/code&gt; by default, but if you use &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to adapt the syntax (but if you use &lt;code&gt;yaml&lt;/code&gt;, you probably know how to do that).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-TOML&#34; data-lang=&#34;TOML&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RSS&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;podcast&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;# Sets up podcast feed&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;outputFormats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;outputFormats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;podcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;MediaType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;application/rss+xml&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;BaseName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;feed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;# Your feed will be located at example.org/feed.xml.&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tells that we&amp;rsquo;re making a new RSS feed template and that it should use it to serve our content. Now, create a new file at &lt;code&gt;layouts/index.podcast.xml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;layouts/index.podcast.xml&lt;/code&gt;, first copy and paste the default Hugo RSS feed template to use as a base.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;

Most of them are &lt;code&gt;itunes&lt;/code&gt; tags because Apple controlled the game early on in podcasts; they never updated the syntax when they rebranded to Apple Podcasts (which is a good thing — if they had, everyone would have had to update their feeds). We&amp;rsquo;re also adding supporting for &lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace&#34;&gt;Podcast Index&amp;rsquo;s newer tags&lt;/a&gt; — you can think of them like a modern, open competitor to Apple. They added a bunch of modern features to podcast feeds (like standardized chapter support and transcripts). Their tags are supported by most modern podcast apps, including Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-channel-tag&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-channel-tag&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        The channel tag&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the first few items in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;channel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.

Be aware that most podcatchers display this information prominently, so make your decision accordingly: if you don&amp;rsquo;t want your full first and last name out there, don&amp;rsquo;t put it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;John Podcast&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we need the &lt;code&gt;itunes:type&lt;/code&gt; tag, which can have two possible values: &lt;code&gt;episodic&lt;/code&gt; (appropriate for most podcasts — episodes don&amp;rsquo;t need to be consumed in any particular order) or &lt;code&gt;serial&lt;/code&gt; (episodes should be consumed sequentially).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;episodic&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;itunes:image&lt;/code&gt; tag is where you&amp;rsquo;ll specify your show&amp;rsquo;s cover art. I also declare this through &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt;, which will display your cover art on the raw RSS feed displayed in a browser, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://yourwebsite.com/cover.png&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#x9;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;https://yourwebsite.com/cover.png&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to specify the category for the show with the &lt;code&gt;itunes:category&lt;/code&gt; tag. Apple &lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasters.apple.com/support/1691-apple-podcasts-categories&#34;&gt;has the full list of available categories and sub-categories here&lt;/a&gt;. For the sake of this example, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;re a podcast about video games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Leisure&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Video Games&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your show is in a category with an ampersand (&amp;amp;), make sure you escape the character, as in the example below. This example also shows how to specify multiple categories if appropriate for your show; you can have up to three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Society &amp;amp;amp; Culture&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#x9;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Documentary&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Health &amp;amp;amp; Fitness&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#x9;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Mental Health&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ampersands break RSS feeds, so why Apple decided to create categories with ampersands, I will never know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll also need to specify if the show is explicit using the &lt;code&gt;itunes:explicit&lt;/code&gt; tag. The possible values are either &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. I am told that Apple can be quite strict about this, so if there&amp;rsquo;s any cursing or adult content on your show, use &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:explicit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;true&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:explicit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure if this part is required, but I have it and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. This is a link to your feed. Obviously, change &lt;code&gt;yourwebsite.com&lt;/code&gt; to your actual domain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;atom:link&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://yourwebsite.com/feed.xml&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;self&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;application/rss+xml&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you changed the &lt;code&gt;BaseName&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt;, make sure it matches here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-item-tag&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-item-tag&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        The item tag&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay — we&amp;rsquo;re all set on the &lt;code&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt; information. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s work on the &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; tag. When Hugo generates your actual RSS feed, there will be an &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; tag for every episode you release. Of course, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to customize it to have some podcast-specific data, just like we did in the &lt;code&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt; tag; this time around, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated. The content in the &lt;code&gt;channel&lt;/code&gt; tag is relatively constant — you&amp;rsquo;re probably not changing the name of your show all that often. But the information we have to provide about our &lt;em&gt;episodes&lt;/em&gt; will, naturally, change on an episode-by-episode basis. This means we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to create some custom parameters that we will then specify in the episode content files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what Hugo has by default:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pubDate&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; tags can all remain as is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; tag renders what will become your show notes. Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s set to your post&amp;rsquo;s summary, which, by default in Hugo, is the first paragraph or so of your post. We want that to be the full text of our post, so we&amp;rsquo;re going to change &lt;code&gt;.Summary&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.Content&lt;/code&gt;, like so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.XMLEscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;safeHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK — now let&amp;rsquo;s dig into actually making these podcast episodes. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be slotting in a lot of custom parameters, which we&amp;rsquo;ll eventually flesh out when we get to our post template. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the episode title. We&amp;rsquo;ve already specified that in the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; tag, but there&amp;rsquo;s an Apple-specific one to declare again. We can reuse the same syntax from before, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;code&gt;itunes:episodeType&lt;/code&gt;, which can be either &lt;code&gt;full&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bonus&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;trailer&lt;/code&gt;. Because this varies on an episode-to-episode basis, we&amp;rsquo;ll need a custom parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:episodeType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:episodeType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll also add a &lt;code&gt;content:encoded&lt;/code&gt; tag. Similar to &lt;code&gt;itunes:title&lt;/code&gt;, this is redundant with another tag (&lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;), but we&amp;rsquo;re aiming for compatibility here. Some older podcast apps still use &lt;code&gt;content:encoded&lt;/code&gt;, so we want to support it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for the &lt;code&gt;itunes:summary&lt;/code&gt; tag. This is your episode&amp;rsquo;s tagline, a preview of its contents. Not all podcast apps surface this, but some do. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use &lt;code&gt;.Summary&lt;/code&gt; here; we&amp;rsquo;ll get to customizing it when we set up our actual post templates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.XMLEscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;safeHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next tag is probably the most important: &lt;code&gt;enclosure&lt;/code&gt;, which is where you link your actual media file. We&amp;rsquo;ll do this with two custom parameters: &lt;code&gt;episodeLength&lt;/code&gt; (a bit of a misnomer — it&amp;rsquo;s the file size in bytes) and &lt;code&gt;episodeURL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;enclosure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;audio/mpeg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the actual &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt; of the episode, we need &lt;code&gt;itunes:duration&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeDuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m choosing to remain consistent with the code&amp;rsquo;s syntax; I wish it was &lt;code&gt;enclosure size&lt;/code&gt; because duration and length are too interchangeable, but it&amp;rsquo;s not, so we will have to solider on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Podcast feeds can also have some episodes marked explicit and some non-explicit, so we have to declare that on an episode-to-episode basis. Imagine, for example, that your show as a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t generally explicit, but on a particular episode, you discuss a Chuck Tingle book — you can mark just that episode as explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:explicit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeExplicit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:explicit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll also need to specify an episode and season number. If your show is episodic, we&amp;rsquo;ll just always use season 1, and podcatchers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t show any season number. But you can also leave out that tag if your show is episodic and you never plan on using seasons. Some episodic shows still use seasons, though, like shows that go on extended breaks. I don&amp;rsquo;t use seasons right now, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to have the opportunity in the future, so I&amp;rsquo;ll include it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:episode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:episode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeSeason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;itunes:season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to build in support for podcast chapters, which are perhaps the greatest innovation in the podcasting space in the last ten years. We&amp;rsquo;re going to wrap this in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement to check if the parameter returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, meaning, your episode has chapters; if it does, we&amp;rsquo;ll use a standard URL format. If it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, this tag won&amp;rsquo;t render. If we didn&amp;rsquo;t do this, there would be a broken link in the feed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Params.episodeChapters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#x9;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;podcast:chapters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;.Permalink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;chapters.json&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;application/json+chapters&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need help generating chapters for your podcast, by the way, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mp3chapters.github.io/&#34;&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a great web-based tool here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll do the same if/else statement for transcripts (for the same reason).

folder, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create another folder titled &lt;code&gt;episodes&lt;/code&gt;. Each episode will go in a folder, like so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;├── content/&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;│   └── episodes/&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;│       └── YYYY-MM-DD Title/&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;│&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;└── chapters.json&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;│&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;└── index.md&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;│&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;└── transcript.vtt&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use the YYYY-MM-DD format for my folders because it keeps them in episode order, but you could easily do something like S01E01. The naming schema is only used for file organization; it&amp;rsquo;s not surfaced on your feed or in your post at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can omit the &lt;code&gt;chapters.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;transcript.vtt&lt;/code&gt; files if that episode doesn&amp;rsquo;t have chapters or a transcript, respectively. The &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; file contains the actual content of our episode. In the frontmatter of every &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; file, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to include the custom parameters that we created in our feed. Let&amp;rsquo;s open up &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; for our first episode and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will start with the standard frontmatter that Hugo requires:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;My First Post&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ld&#34;&gt;2024-01-14T07:07:07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;+01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;draft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;Type your shownotes in markdown format here!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s address the &lt;code&gt;itunes:subtitle&lt;/code&gt; tag, which is currently set to pull Hugo&amp;rsquo;s post summary. By default, Hugo will just use the first paragraph of your post as a summary. If that works for you, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do this next step, but if you want want to specify a custom subtitle for your episode, you can add in the &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;My First Post&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ld&#34;&gt;2024-01-14T07:07:07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;+01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;draft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;This is my episode subtitle!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ln&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;Type your shownotes in markdown format here!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK — now onto the parameters that we created for our podcast feed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;  &lt;thead&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;Parameter&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;episodeType&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;String&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;full&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bonus&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;trailer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;episodeLength&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;Number&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;The length (in bytes) of your media file.

You can probably automate this a bit with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/&#34;&gt;a custom archetype&lt;/a&gt;, but I usually just copy and paste the frontmatter from the previous post and tweak it as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, you just have to build and deploy your site. Your feed will be found at &lt;code&gt;yourwebsite.com/feed.xml&lt;/code&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to manually submit that feed to the major podcast directories, but that&amp;rsquo;s a one time deal; once you&amp;rsquo;re listed, the apps should refresh shortly after you publish your episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see this at work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitchandplay.org/&#34;&gt;Pitch &amp;amp; Play&lt;/a&gt;. Do note that I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few customizations to the feed template for my show specifically — I&amp;rsquo;m a dumbass who put an ampersand in their show name and I had to work around that. I followed the same basic protocol for &lt;a href=&#34;https://podtrificustotalus.com/&#34;&gt;Podtrificus Totalus&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the feed structure is outdated because I generated that site further back than Pitch &amp;amp; Play. Both sites use custom themes; they&amp;rsquo;re bespoke and probably a bit janky, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be releasing them to the public for use, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie/&#34;&gt;repos for them are public&lt;/a&gt;, so you can steal whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to test your feed? I like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://podba.se/validate/&#34;&gt;Podbase Validator&lt;/a&gt;; you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://podba.se/validate/?url=https://pitchandplay.org/feed.xml&#34;&gt;run Pitch &amp;amp; Play&amp;rsquo;s feed directly by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this post helped you — or if something isn&amp;rsquo;t working — feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;http://cassie.ink/about/&#34;&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think about bringing Pitch &amp;amp; Play back sometimes because I truly do miss podcasting and I like talking about games. I walked away from the Harry Potter one for obvious reasons, and the one before that I won&amp;rsquo;t mention because episodes of it still exist online (outside of my control) and I&amp;rsquo;d rather not attach myself to them.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a bloated monster that constantly has security patches, and the founder is super problematic.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m failing the Byte-range support test right now, but that&amp;rsquo;s related to where my media is hosted, not the RSS feed — and in my testing, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that&amp;rsquo;s actually a problem.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to have my basic syllabus done within the next week or two, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really plan that way, so I&amp;rsquo;m going week by week and outlining the entire lesson. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, but I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/026/&#34;&gt;feeling a lot better than I was last week&lt;/a&gt;. I was previously trying to reverse engineer the previous professor&amp;rsquo;s syllabus while bringing in some of my own resources, but I gave myself permission to do my own thing and only consult her work when I felt I needed something more for a lesson or a text. I&amp;rsquo;m moving much faster and things feel easier now, so it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the idea for a while now of buying a new monitor for my desk at work — the school issues me one (and I asked for a second to have a dual monitor setup, which they did give me), but they&amp;rsquo;re pretty bottom of the barrel office displays. They&amp;rsquo;re not even 1080p, which is a real pain for grading on our archaic LMS. I hunted around for deals on a cheap display, but I found that anything worth spending money on far outpaced my displays at home (a Dell S2340M that I bought in 2015 and an ASUS VZ239H-W from 2016 that I inherited from my sister). I ended up cashing in some of my credit card rewards points and taking advantage of a sale&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get a KTC H27T22C-3, which will be a big upgrade for me (23&amp;quot; to 27&amp;quot;; 1080p to 1440p; much higher refresh rate and a new IPS panel). Then I got on my bullshit and started researching monitor arms — I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted one, but neither of my previous displays were VESA compatible. I found a crazy deal for a white Ergotron MXV dual monitor mount on eBay (a little over $100 shipped), bought a VESA adapter for the Dell and a plate to distribute the weight on my desk, and now I&amp;rsquo;m just waiting for everything to come in. This coming school year, I really want to stop staying at work so late and just do my grading and planning at home, where I have a much more comfortable and quality set up&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (including a Steelcase Leap v2, which I recently found on Facebook Marketplace in mint condition for $175).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also justifying my recent exorbitant spending on my office as a way to stop spending so much fucking time on my phone and instead put that energy into writing, building websites, playing games, and maybe getting back into content creation.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll take the ASUS to school; maybe a few years down the line when they get to be reasonably priced, I&amp;rsquo;ll get an OLED and replace the Dell, but for now, it works just fine for a secondary display.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my reading from here on out is going to be prep work for my college class and for the coming school year. I read through all of &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt; by Laurie Halse Anderson, which I&amp;rsquo;m glad to say is as good as I remember it — it was a favorite of mine as a teen. I also recently learned that there&amp;rsquo;s a graphic novel version that I&amp;rsquo;d like to get my hands on one day. Frankly, I&amp;rsquo;d love to teach this book one day in the classroom (not for a college course) — even if it is dated in terms of publication year (the themes are perennial) — but that&amp;rsquo;s not really possible with the age group that I teach right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My next read is &lt;em&gt;All Boys Aren&amp;rsquo;t Blue&lt;/em&gt; by George Matthew Johnson, which I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through. I think it&amp;rsquo;s an essential book in the current YA landscape, even if cloyingly self-important in spots. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have it in my syllabus and am generally enjoying it, though I expected something far more controversial given the ire it has attracted. Johnson explains elementary concepts around racism, homophobia, and patriarchy with simple language and remarkable patience to make the text accessible for young people and those beginning their journeys toward confronting their biases, but as someone who has been steeped in those ideas for over a decade now, it all feels a little too basic. That&amp;rsquo;s more about me than a critique of the book, of course; it knows its audience and serves it well — I&amp;rsquo;m just not the target.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also refreshing myself on chapters from &lt;em&gt;Literature for Young Adults: Books (and More) for Contemporary Readers&lt;/em&gt; by Joan L. Knickerbocker and James A. Rycik, which is our textbook for the course and is about as exciting as it sounds (though useful). I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of supplementary materials and research articles to pair with the novels, too. I know &lt;em&gt;The House on Mango Street&lt;/em&gt; by Sandra Cisneros well enough that I was able to plan from memory, but I pulled two poems from &lt;em&gt;Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood&lt;/em&gt; by Judith Ortiz Cofer to pair with it. I first read the better part of &lt;em&gt;Silent Dancing&lt;/em&gt; in undergrad — I think for a world lit class — and really loved it; the title story is particularly resonant and haunting. I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back and read it in full when I&amp;rsquo;m less bogged down with work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I are still watching old seasons of &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt; — we&amp;rsquo;re on &lt;em&gt;Caramoan&lt;/em&gt; right now. There are no returning players for 50 on it, but we enjoyed &lt;em&gt;South Pacific&lt;/em&gt;, and I see &lt;em&gt;Caramoan&lt;/em&gt; as kind of part two of that season. We&amp;rsquo;re still following &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzb96hSa04DPbyVmGawLPUYr9DUG99k8Q&#34;&gt;Austin Walker&amp;rsquo;s Let&amp;rsquo;s Play of &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic II&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt; and then watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIAGhNc7IWXxCHc55BwOsuTgMrDM8smSU&#34;&gt;Friends at the Table Ali&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Mistria&lt;/em&gt; Mondays&lt;/a&gt; when we need turn off our brain content. I&amp;rsquo;ve pushed into season four of &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s losing its luster. I would like to maybe finish it, though&amp;hellip; again, maybe when I&amp;rsquo;m less busy with work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/153657125?share=copy&#34;&gt;a pretty bad short film called &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt; (2016)&lt;/a&gt; — I was hoping to maybe find resources for my college class on pairing film with books that wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the actual &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt; film adaptation with Kristen Stewart, but this won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. I rewatched &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; and found enough for my purposes. I remember thinking it was a great adaptation when I saw it as a teen, but on rewatching it, you can tell it&amp;rsquo;s a Lifetime flick. It was stunning to see Bart Bass as Mr. Neck, however.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back on my &lt;em&gt;Fields of Mistria&lt;/em&gt; bullshit. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;ve exhausted a lot of the content currently available, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad place to be — I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; just about everything (except heart events, which I really don&amp;rsquo;t interact with in these types of games) and now can focus on 100%ing things and beautifying my farm. There&amp;rsquo;s still a few things that will unlock at higher town ranks, and I can keep looking forward to the regular updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&lt;/em&gt; again when my new monitor came in so that I could see something that isn&amp;rsquo;t just pixel art. I&amp;rsquo;m in early Act 3, but I feel a bit frustrated and disillusioned with the game. I feel constantly as though I&amp;rsquo;m missing out on things, I save scum every roll, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking up every decision I make for its ramifications. I know I need to just trust the playthrough and let things unfold naturally, but I&amp;rsquo;m also obsessed with having the best possible outcomes and seeing everything — the game is &lt;em&gt;so long&lt;/em&gt; that I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself replaying it any time soon. I&amp;rsquo;m also just fatigued with it, in a way. I thought time away from it would help, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t. There are so many running storylines, and I&amp;rsquo;m so ready for an end to be in sight, but I know that, in all likelihood, I have a good 20 hours left ahead of me. I also know I&amp;rsquo;ve missed out on two stories — one relatively minor, the other really fucking major — due to the game&amp;rsquo;s frankly baffling design decisions. Long, deep games are a good thing when you&amp;rsquo;re in the mood for it, but I&amp;rsquo;m ready to just be done — I love so much of what is here, but I also feel like I&amp;rsquo;m fighting against the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;em&gt;Tapestry&lt;/em&gt; by Carole King. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why — I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really going to be for me. It&amp;rsquo;s a legendary album and I&amp;rsquo;m sure deserves its place in music history, but as an individual listener in 2025, I found it a bit ho-hum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also listened to &lt;a href=&#34;%5Bhttps://pca.st/5wv7133q%5D(https://pca.st/5wv7133q&#34; title=&#34;https://pca.st/5wv7133q&#34;&gt;Outside the Lobby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s episode on &lt;em&gt;The Order 1886&lt;/em&gt; after one of the hosts shared it in a Discord group I&amp;rsquo;m in. It was a great, funny episode that I enjoyed despite being an &lt;em&gt;Order&lt;/em&gt; sicko (they were quite negative about the game). I&amp;rsquo;m so fucking into music lately that I don&amp;rsquo;t make much time for podcast listening, but I would like to listen to more of their episodes. I have started trying to listen to podcasts while running (though I think I still prefer music) and while doing my hair and moisturizing after a shower — the result is that I&amp;rsquo;m  listening to Brendon Bigley&amp;rsquo;s new podcast, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pod.link/wavelengths&#34;&gt;Wavelengths&lt;/a&gt;, in ten minute slices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music-wise, I also listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ninajirachi.bandcamp.com/album/i-love-my-computer&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Love My Computer&lt;/em&gt; by Ninajirachi&lt;/a&gt;, which fucking bangs. Recommended for fans of Charli XCX&amp;rsquo;s earlier, more PC music-adjacent era&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and general hyperpop/EDM folks. Listen to &amp;ldquo;Fuck My Computer,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Delete,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;All I Am&amp;rdquo; for a taste of what the whole album is like; I&amp;rsquo;m particularly enamored with &amp;ldquo;Sing Good,&amp;rdquo; but the whole album feels like an ode to teenage creativity and terminally online behavior, for which I am squarely in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly cutting down on my Amazon purchasing — I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to be almost entirely off of it soon — but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any brick and mortar electronics stores around me aside from Walmart, which feels like a lateral move&amp;hellip; and a bitch needs a discount every now and then.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would be doing no work outside of the school day, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the reality of teaching — and also I am a workaholic and perfectionist.

I&amp;rsquo;m starting to put together my syllabus and lesson plans. I have a lot of resources from the previous professor (who is a friend), but I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to do my own thing. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work and I&amp;rsquo;m very stressed about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s only just August, but it somehow feels like the summer is already over. It&amp;rsquo;s the Sunday scaries month of the summer for me, which is ridiculous because who else gets two months off from their job every year? (Aside from, you know, people in civilized countries that get actual vacation days.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;Mood Machine&lt;/em&gt;. It was fantastic — an illuminating look into the music industry and perhaps one of the great anti-capitalist works of this decade. Pelly offers no easy solutions (a problem this big and complex wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any) but rather a call to action for a societal and economic shift toward collectivism and independence rather than a corporate machine that devalues artists and alienates individuals. Highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I now need to start reading through the books for my syllabus — they&amp;rsquo;re all young adult lit and books I&amp;rsquo;ve read before, so they go fast. &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt; by Laurie Halse Anderson is first up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I watched through &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzb96hSa04DPbyVmGawLPUYr9DUG99k8Q&#34;&gt;Austin Walker&amp;rsquo;s Let&amp;rsquo;s Play of &lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic II&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;— or at least, what he has out right now, which is through Dxun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to play &lt;em&gt;Mistria&lt;/em&gt; at all this week because we&amp;rsquo;ve been in and out of town, but it is very much on my mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t use my Switch much, but I would play the hell out of this game in handheld — or perhaps on a Steam Deck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still coming down from the high of the Rainbow Kitten Surprise concert, so I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been listening to them (and shuffles on car rides).

I also &amp;ldquo;worked&amp;rdquo; two days this week: I had committee meetings on Thursday and then a joint meeting to coordinate middle school/high school/college GSAs in my area. I also went to a concert (more about that in the music section) with a friend who moved away a year ago and who I missed a lot!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; this week, completing a long-standing personal mission to read &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie/cassiedotink.git&#34;&gt;wrote up a big long post&lt;/a&gt; with my history with the series and my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally, I planned to read &lt;em&gt;Perdido Street Station&lt;/em&gt; by China Miéville next, but I wanted something breezy after the &lt;em&gt;RotK&lt;/em&gt; gauntlet, so I picked up &lt;em&gt;Ghost Boys&lt;/em&gt; by Jewell Parker Rhodes and burned through it in a day. It was amazing. I&amp;rsquo;m adjuncting at my local college in the fall — it&amp;rsquo;s a course for future English teachers about young adult literature. I&amp;rsquo;m considering offering students a choice of this or &lt;em&gt;All American Boys&lt;/em&gt;. Both deal with a similar subject matter, but &lt;em&gt;Ghost Boys&lt;/em&gt; is better suited for middle school. I&amp;rsquo;d love to teach the book to my middle schoolers, too, but I think that will be an uphill battle&amp;hellip;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My next read is &lt;em&gt;Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist&lt;/em&gt; by Liz Pelly. I&amp;rsquo;m about 100 pages in and really enjoying it — I&amp;rsquo;m not usually one for non-fiction, but I also am a noted Spotify hater (and have been for a long time), so this felt like a good way to dip my toe in. Highly recommend!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been rewatching &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m in season two right now; I&amp;rsquo;m debating whether to finish the series (I never watched past season five, I think) or if I&amp;rsquo;ll stop when they kill off some major characters in season three. I am glad to confirm that I was always right: Mary is the main character and the best character. I am noticing more and more the ridiculous plotlines, however — I maintained for years that seasons one and two were actually good and after that it descended into soap opera melodrama, but I am older and wiser now. I think I&amp;rsquo;d still recommend the first season, but stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I have been burning through a lot of &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt; seasons to prepare for 50. Mostly, they&amp;rsquo;re rewatches for me, which I don&amp;rsquo;t mind.

I love &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; and have sunk hundreds of hours into it, but lately, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I could go back — &lt;em&gt;Mistria&lt;/em&gt; has so many convenience and quality of life features that make &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; feel old and clunky by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time at my computer, which means I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of music!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of &lt;strong&gt;Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/strong&gt; lately as a lead up to seeing them in concert. I really enjoy them — when I last mentioned them, I think I&amp;rsquo;d only listened to &lt;em&gt;RKS&lt;/em&gt;, on a friend&amp;rsquo;s recommendation; I&amp;rsquo;ve since rounded out their discography. Here is my slipshod and unscientific personal ranking of their discography:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;RKS&lt;/em&gt; - their best and most consistent; this is an &lt;em&gt;album&lt;/em&gt;, an entire vibe, worth listening through in one sitting. Listen to &amp;ldquo;Cold Love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wasted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven + Mary&lt;/em&gt; - a rough sketch of what they would eventually realize on &lt;em&gt;RKS,&lt;/em&gt; but I like it — I think I have a lot of 2013 nostalgia. Listen to &amp;ldquo;First Class&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;American Hero.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to: Friend, Love, Freefall&lt;/em&gt; - Great moments and some real stand out tracks, but it gets too same-y for me in places. Listen to &amp;ldquo;Moody Orange&amp;rdquo; (maybe my favorite song by them) and &amp;ldquo;Fever Pitch&amp;rdquo; (add in &amp;ldquo;Possum Queen&amp;rdquo; if you want a weird one that will stick in your head)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Hate Music Box&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of ups and downs with this one: I think it has too many songs and the good ones maybe didn&amp;rsquo;t get to bake long enough. But the more I sit with it and take the songs as they are, the more I like it. Listen to &amp;ldquo;Lucky&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sickset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw them in concert on Sunday and thought they put on a fucking great show. Amazing setlist, minimal talking, and fantastic performance. I&amp;rsquo;ve been so wishy-washy with concerts in the past, so it was nice to have a win.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I listened through to &lt;a href=&#34;https://beingdead.bandcamp.com/album/eels&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;EELS&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Being Dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well, which is a real rad vibe all throughout. &amp;ldquo;Love Machine&amp;rdquo; might be my favorite song I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this year; &amp;ldquo;Van Goes&amp;rdquo; also has big &amp;ldquo;Bela Lugosi&amp;rsquo;s Dead&amp;rdquo; vibes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also, for some reason, thought about the band &lt;strong&gt;The Madrigals&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time in a long time, which I&amp;rsquo;m sure I discovered on MySpace or last.fm or some other defunct platform. There&amp;rsquo;s very little remaining about them online, but I have a few MP3s of theirs that I probably downloaded from one of the aforementioned sites. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dandelionradio.com/tracklists/2008-04/index.htm&#34;&gt;cool as fuck old radio archive website that mentions them&lt;/a&gt; (and has a radio show with one of their songs still archived!), and I  &lt;a href=&#34;http://thestreetlampdoesntcast.blogspot.com/2011/02/griff-says-land-ahoy-its-columbus.html&#34;&gt;stumbled on a music blog from 2011&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned some of the members&amp;rsquo; later bands, which led to me downloading &lt;a href=&#34;https://upsettherhythm.bandcamp.com/album/horizon&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Trash Kit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I gave it a listen through — there are some great, skittery guitars in here, and the vocals remind me a lot of &lt;strong&gt;Ponytail&lt;/strong&gt;. It gets a little too jam band for me in places, and the songs are quite same-y. I really like &amp;ldquo;Happy Sad,&amp;rdquo; though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plexamp recommended &lt;em&gt;Random Spirit Lover&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Sunset Rubdown&lt;/strong&gt; as a similar album after I finished listening through to &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had both in my library for ages — I think I downloaded Sunset Rubdown&amp;rsquo;s entire discography at some point because I like a few of their songs. I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like either as whole albums, but I have loved (and continue to love) &amp;ldquo;You Go on Ahead (Trumpet Trumpet II).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But one worth climbing&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time ago (and a time, and a time), I had a podcast. I miss podcasting dearly and think about going back often — otherwise, what am I to do with a partial, flawed understanding of normalizing to a target loudness and editing around the disgusting noises my mouth makes? Well, share it with others, of course.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case it was not clear, I am not a professional. I am a blockhead who likes to tinker and who has watched a lot of YouTube videos. These are the FX chains I use for my voice, which may or may not be helpful to other people who do not have my voice. This is also not an exhaustive audio guide or overview of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I edit my audio. Maybe another time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I use a RØDE Procaster as my microphone and a MOTU M2 as my interface. I have a Fethead between the two because otherwise people complain I am too quiet on Discord. I bought a pop filter designed for the RØDE Podmic; it fits on my Procaster and works, but it looks a little ridiculous, so sometimes I get risqué and take it off.  I paid several hundred dollars for this setup so that I can capture my two dollar voice with fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back when I was podcasting with a co-host over long distances, I swore by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ecastr.com/&#34;&gt;Ennuicaster&lt;/a&gt; for recording because I admired the creator&amp;rsquo;s pedantic approach to audio and hostility toward their end user.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Ennuicaster is clunky and temperamental, but the pricing model is fair and the audio it spits out is top-notch.  It is also the only recording application that I know of with a prominently featured weasel mascot. If I&amp;rsquo;m recording just myself, or something in person, I record straight into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reaper.fm/&#34;&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, which I also use to edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a project template set up to automatically open in Reaper with my FX chains. Theoretically, they are specific to my voice, but I imagine you can steal a lot of this for yourself. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to explain what each step does and provide an audio sample for A/B comparison.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the raw audio I&amp;rsquo;ll work with, with no editing aside from when I fucked up the second sentence of my favorite book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-1.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Raw Audio&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;individual-track-chain&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#individual-track-chain&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Individual Track Chain&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I start by normalizing the track to -23 LUFS. It&amp;rsquo;s important to normalize as if it&amp;rsquo;s one long item — I made cuts where I messed up, and if I normalized each item individually, there would be weird modulations in volume mid-sentence. Our final target volume will be -19 LUFS (for a mono podcast); I start with -23 to give me some headroom — I&amp;rsquo;ll boost later in the chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20220700.png&#34; alt=&#34;Normalization&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-2.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after normalization&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I start adding FX to my individual track (not the master). I have collected many paid VSTs over the years; you can almost certainly copy their exact effects into Reaper&amp;rsquo;s free (and excellent) equivalents. I start with &lt;strong&gt;FabFilter&amp;rsquo;s Pro-DS&lt;/strong&gt;, which removes some of the harsh sibilance.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I believe this is almost entirely the &amp;ldquo;Female Wide Band&amp;rdquo; preset. The settings are pretty conservative; I used to really hammer them down and produced many podcast episodes where I sounded as though I had a lisp.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20221619.png&#34; alt=&#34;De-essing&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mode: Single Vocal&#xD;&#xA;Threshold: -36 dB&#xD;&#xA;Range: 6 dB&#xD;&#xA;Band Processing: Wide Band&#xD;&#xA;Lookahead: 12.00 ms (enabled)&#xD;&#xA;High-Pass Frequency: 6.834 kHz&#xD;&#xA;Low-Pass Frequnecy: 14 kHz&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like Pro-DS because it has a nice display of what it is and isn&amp;rsquo;t attenuating. You could easily achieve this with a free de-esser or an EQ curve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-3-ds.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after de-essing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I incidentally picked a great passage to read — there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; sounds. Can you notice a difference? Probably not, but they are ever-so-slightly softer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is &lt;strong&gt;Mouth De-click&lt;/strong&gt; from iZotope. If you spend money on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; VST, I really recommend this one. It gets rid of the disgusting wet mouth sounds. If you ever want to vomit, check the box that says &amp;ldquo;Output clicks only&amp;rdquo; and listen through to your audio. I am almost certainly using a preset here, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20223107.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mouth De-Click&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sensitivity: 4.00&#xD;&#xA;Frequency Skew: 0.00&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-4.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after Mouth De-click&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, I use &lt;strong&gt;ReaGate&lt;/strong&gt; as to reduce noise and breaths, which I believe I copied &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBKoC1sPtWs&#34;&gt;almost entirely from this video&lt;/a&gt;.  I tend to inhale sharply when I laugh, and I am in general not very good at breathing, so the gate cleans that up a little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20223529.png&#34; alt=&#34;ReaGate&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Threshold: -27 dB&#xD;&#xA;Attack: 3 ms&#xD;&#xA;Release: 100 ms&#xD;&#xA;Pre-open: 5 ms&#xD;&#xA;Hold: 5 ms&#xD;&#xA;Lowpass: 20000 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Hipass: 0 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Dry: -11.5 dB&#xD;&#xA;Wet: -3.8 dB&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the video goes into this, but there&amp;rsquo;s a mix of  &amp;ldquo;wet&amp;rdquo; (the processed audio) and &amp;ldquo;dry&amp;rdquo; (the raw audio) going on here to make the effect a little more smooth: I&amp;rsquo;m not removing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the breath, just attenuating it. I like to think of it like lowering the opacity for a breathing layer in Photoshop. I have no recollection of how I arrived at these numbers, but I like them. In the example below, pay attention to the word &amp;ldquo;neighborhood&amp;rdquo; — the breath after it is way less noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-5.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after gate&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the gate can make certain words or laughs sound funny, in which case I use a bypass envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time for an EQ, which is perhaps the part of this chain most specific to my voice. I spent a lot of time playing with curves and settings (and, again, watching YouTube videos) until I found something I liked for my nasally voice. I am using FabFilter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Pro-Q 4&lt;/strong&gt;, but again, you can just copy my curve into whatever EQ VST that you have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20224618.png&#34; alt=&#34;EQ Curve&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Band 1 Frequency: 80 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Band 1 Gain: 0.00 dB&#xD;&#xA;Band 1 Q: 1.036&#xD;&#xA;Band 1 Shape: Low Cut&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Band 2 Frequency: 194.49 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Band 2 Gain: +3.59 dB&#xD;&#xA;Band 2 Q: .765&#xD;&#xA;Band 2 Shape: Bell&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Band 3 Frequency: 617 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Band 3 Gain: -5.14 dB&#xD;&#xA;Band 3 Q: 2.096&#xD;&#xA;Band 3 Shape: Bell&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Band 4 Frequency: 6966 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Band 4 Gain: +3.51 dB&#xD;&#xA;Band 4 Q: 1.0&#xD;&#xA;Band 4 Shape: High Shelf&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found this curve preserves a faithful representation of my voice but makes it a little more warm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-6.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after EQing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I add a second EQ curve — this time to tamp down the remaining sibilance, which may have been amplified by my previous EQ curve. The next step is compression where I don&amp;rsquo;t want to further accentuate my whistly &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; sounds. This curve is again specific to my voice — I swept for the frequency that I found harsh and attenuated it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20225711.png&#34; alt=&#34;EQ De-essing&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Band 1 Frequency: 5540 Hz&#xD;&#xA;Band 1 Gain: -3.00 dB&#xD;&#xA;Band 1 Q: 3.800&#xD;&#xA;Band 1 Shape: Bell&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will still be whistle in here — I&amp;rsquo;m working with the voice that I have — but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit smoother.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-7.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after second de-essing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to compress! A compressor helps to even out the difference between loud speech and quieter speech. The example audio that I&amp;rsquo;m using here is pretty even to begin with, but when I&amp;rsquo;m talking to another human, I tend to be less monotone. I&amp;rsquo;m again using a FabFilter VST — &lt;strong&gt;Pro-C 2&lt;/strong&gt; — but you can copy these settings into any compressor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20225928.png&#34; alt=&#34;Compression&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Threshold: -12 dB&#xD;&#xA;Ratio: 4.00:1&#xD;&#xA;Knee: +18.00 dB&#xD;&#xA;Range: +60.00 dB&#xD;&#xA;Attack: 1.000 ms&#xD;&#xA;Release: 100.0 ms&#xD;&#xA;Lookahead: 0.300 ms&#xD;&#xA;Hold: 0.000 ms&#xD;&#xA;Wet: 100%&#xD;&#xA;Dry: 0%&#xD;&#xA;Auto Gain: On&#xD;&#xA;Output Level: +2.00 dB&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step boosts the overall loudness of the track, so the example audio should seem a bit boosted compared to the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-8.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after compressing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This next step is entirely optional, but I use Slate&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://slatedigital.com/fresh-air-2/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to add a little bit of presence to my voice and get a touch of that NPR sound. It is very easy to overdo this effect, so take a tempered hand with it. The plug-in is free if you give them your email address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20230542.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fresh Air&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mid-Air: 24%&#xD;&#xA;High Air: 14%&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-9.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after Fresh Air&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, for my individual track, I apply a limiter (&lt;strong&gt;ReaLimit&lt;/strong&gt;) just to knock down any remaining peaks. Again, this is a fairly monotone clip, and I&amp;rsquo;m conservative with my levels, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t kick in much at all here — it&amp;rsquo;s more of a safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20230835.png&#34; alt=&#34;ReaLimit&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Threshold: -2.00 dB&#xD;&#xA;Ceiling: -1.00 dB&#xD;&#xA;Release: 15.0 dB/sec&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-10.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Audio after limiting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the end of the processing I do on my individual track. A co-host or guest&amp;rsquo;s chain would be fairly similar, but I would tweak the EQ curve and de-essers to suit their voice and possibly add some more aggressive noise removal depending on their recording conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To recap, here is the chain for my &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; track:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Normalize entire track to -23 LUFS (treat as one item)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;De-ess&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mouth De-click&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ReaGate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;EQ&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;EQ (to de-ess)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compressor&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ReaLimit&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This latest example is peaking at -1.00 dB (thanks to the limiter), and the LUFS-I measure is -15.8. That&amp;rsquo;s a little too loud for a podcast, but we&amp;rsquo;ll take care of that on the master track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;master-track-chain&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#master-track-chain&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Master Track Chain&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The example audio I&amp;rsquo;ve been using only has one speaker, and if I was a solo podcaster, I could just put this chain at the end of the other chain. But if you have multiple hosts, or you use sound effects, you need to make sure that the audio is balanced — like if two people are talking at the same time (which you should generally avoid anyway). Additionally, we want to hit a target of or around -19 LUFS. I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand LUFS but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to explain it nonetheless: LUFS is a measure of the &lt;em&gt;average perceived loudness&lt;/em&gt; of audio. There may be spikes or some quieter portions, but on &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; we want our podcast to hit -19 LUFS (a broadcast standard for mono audio). If all podcasts do this — which they should — it will mean that you can listen to an episode of one show then switch to a different show without having to adjust your device&amp;rsquo;s volume. Ideally, dynamically inserted ads would also hit -19.0 LUFS and therefore be at the same perceived loudness as the regular episode, too. This has not been my experience with even professional shows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, LUFS isn&amp;rsquo;t the only measure we care about, because we could reach an average but still have a wide dynamic range. We&amp;rsquo;ve already taken care of that, though, with our compression on the individual tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use only one effect on the master track. It is &lt;strong&gt;Waves PlaylistRider Mono,&lt;/strong&gt; which takes care of the loudness targeting for me through some wizardry. &lt;a href=&#34;https://plugins4free.com/plugin/2753/&#34;&gt;TriLeveler 2&lt;/a&gt; is a great free alternative that has way more buttons and sliders, but PlaylistRider works well for a knucklehead like me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2025/07/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20232151.png&#34; alt=&#34;Waves PlaylistRider Mono&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tonal Character: On&#xD;&#xA;Attack: Slow&#xD;&#xA;Detector Threshold: -36 dB&#xD;&#xA;Target LKFS: -19&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I also have a Loudness Meter on the master track, but that&amp;rsquo;s just for measuring.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-11.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Final processed audio&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the raw audio again, just for the sake of comparison:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;audio controls preload=&#34;metadata&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;      &lt;source src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/audio/2025/fxchainexample-1.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/audio&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Raw Audio&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This last export measures at -18.8 LUFS with a peak of -1.0 dB and an LRA of 3.6. Nobody is going to cry about ± 0.2 LUFS, so I&amp;rsquo;m happy with what I have. However, if you want to be really sure, you can use the &lt;strong&gt;Normalize/fade&lt;/strong&gt; option when you render your final export in Reaper; after Reaper finishes processing the export, it will apply a final boost to get to your target LUFS. In my experience, this works fine, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather do the loudness targeting on my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;please-be-aware-that-i-have-absolutely-no-fucking-clue-what-im-doing-ever&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#please-be-aware-that-i-have-absolutely-no-fucking-clue-what-im-doing-ever&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Please be aware that I have absolutely no fucking clue what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, ever.&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure there are audio snobs reading this and laughing at my incompetence. I hope I have made clear that I&amp;rsquo;m a dunce who has watched a lot of YouTube tutorials, so you can spare me the elitist bullshit: it&amp;rsquo;s on you for expecting me to speak with any kind of authority. Of course, if you have genuine, well-meaning corrections, advice, or just ideas for me to play with, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear that! I love to tinker; I take pride in audio that I produce (despite appearances) and enjoy learning more. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the audio I spit out, even though it&amp;rsquo;s far from perfect — but I hope what &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/em&gt; learned can help other jackasses like me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To anyone podcasting, or thinking about podcasting, please &lt;em&gt;just start.&lt;/em&gt; I have fallen into the gear acquisition syndrome trap too many times and told myself I need a $200 microphone and dozens of VSTs to get great sound. You don&amp;rsquo;t, and you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; great sound, either. There&amp;rsquo;s a level of &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; audio that will please your listeners who are probably smashing episodes through their $12 dirty buds, anyway. Focus on having fun and making shit that makes you smile. That&amp;rsquo;s all we have in the end.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe the internet should be a platform for sharing information freely and openly.

        &lt;p&gt;Peter Jackson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/em&gt; released in 2001 when I was seven years old. At the time, my media diet consisted mostly of &lt;em&gt;The Powerpuff Girls&lt;/em&gt; and obsessively reading and re-reading the first four &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; books.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I would like to say that my father was thoughtful and felt that I would have enjoyed another fantasy series with wizards and magic but knew that a three-plus-hour theater experience was tall ask for a seven year old. Unfortunately, I know him, and I think it more likely that he is cheap and thought the movie looked cool, so when &lt;em&gt;Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; released on home media, we trucked to the neighborhood  knock-off and rented it on VHS. That night, I crowded with my two older siblings around a (by today&amp;rsquo;s standards) laughably small tube TV. We tucked in with no expectations or understanding of what the movie would be about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to say that I was surprised and delighted by the mystical adventure, high fantasy setting, and well-sketched characters. Instead I was terrified by the scant glimpses of Gollum and suffered the first sleepless night inspired by a movie I can recall.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I doubt I understood much of the plot: the only impressions I can recall are &amp;ldquo;swords and magic are cool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;maybe  Dad should be screening these movies before he shows them to us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-mania, of course, consumed the early 2000s, and I became ever-so-slightly less of a chickenshit. My siblings and I were obsessed with the films; we watched them repeatedly and anxiously awaited each release. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember seeing &lt;em&gt;Two Towers&lt;/em&gt; for the first time (though the scene of Aragorn opening the doors to Helms Deep is etched in my brain as a core memory), but we did see &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; in theaters. I also spent a sleepless night after it, but my insomnia stemmed instead from violent puking fits of popcorn and Sierra Mist.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At some point, my brother picked up the books to read. He and I both were avid young readers — again, at that point, mostly of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; and the ilk&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — and I can remember him spoiling the ending of &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; for me before the movie came out. Upon finishing the &amp;ldquo;Mount Doom&amp;rdquo; chapter, he excitedly asked me if I wanted to know how the series ended. I dithered, and he announced that the Ring was destroyed when Gollum took it from Frodo then fell into the cracks of Mount Doom.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s stupid,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, hoping for a more epic conclusion to the saga. I had tried around age 10 to read the books, too — I started with &lt;em&gt;Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; and skipped what I saw as the &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; chapters (&amp;ldquo;Tom Bombadil,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Council of Elrond,&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and probably the parts of the ending that didn&amp;rsquo;t involve sword fights). I tried &lt;em&gt;Two Towers&lt;/em&gt; a few times after, which I insisted was the best in the series&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but never made it more than halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am here over twenty years later to correct the thought crimes and dishonesty of my childhood self: over the last decade, I have achieved a longstanding personal mission to, at last, read through all of — and skip no chapters in — &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my teen and young adult years, I remained an avid fan of the movies — my partner and I bonded over watching them in our early relationship, but I would always have to reveal my secret shame in never actually cracking the covers of the books (especially as I attended college as an English and Education dual major). When I started subbing, then teaching, I knew I had to finish the books, as I could not submit myself to the mockery of twelve-year-olds who &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; read the books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;em&gt;Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; in probably 2018 or 2019 and breezed through it with relative ease,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with a few resolutions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would read every chapter, even if they were boring. (Sorry, Tom Bombadil.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would read other things in between, to avoid burnout.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would skim or mostly skip the songs, which are also mostly boring and could, with a few exceptions, be edited out without any detriment to the reader&amp;rsquo;s experience.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I continued on through &lt;em&gt;Two Towers&lt;/em&gt; and began to feel fatigue — I think this is less of a controversial take, but Tolkien needed an editor to help him better discover the balance between legitimate world-building and shit for nerds that should be relegated to footnotes and appendices. At one point, in the middle of the &amp;ldquo;Helm&amp;rsquo;s Deep&amp;rdquo; chapter — arguably the major climax of Aragorn&amp;rsquo;s plot in Book Three — I fell asleep while reading and it was not late at night. I took a few years&amp;rsquo; break from the series after that, as I become busier and busier in my day job my patience eroded for reading about another field or flower or bloodline for pages upon pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year, however, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/week-notes/015/&#34;&gt;part of my resolution to read more&lt;/a&gt;, I was at my local bookshop and spotted a copy of &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I added it to my bag, started the book in probably May of this year, and finally finished it this week.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will plant my flag and say that I think &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; the finest in the series; Tolkien beautifully weaves the interlaced narrative together here, which has enough tension and intersection to bear me through his purple prose about nature and unflagging world building with only minor grumbling.  What especially struck me, however, was Frodo and Sam&amp;rsquo;s harrowing journey across Mordor — it was here that Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s penchant for detail clicked for me, as the reader is treated to an arduous accounting of every drop of water, every crumb of bread that Sam rations (and goes without) across the ashy wastelands of Mordor. By comparison, the destruction of the Ring seems to pass with relatively little fanfare. The movies portray it (and all) with bombastic melodrama (affectionate), from Sam&amp;rsquo;s protestation that he will carry Frodo the rest of the way up the mountain to his rescue of Frodo as he dangles bloodily from a cliff above the fires of Mount Doom. The book instead centers Sam&amp;rsquo;s limited view of the events: he enters the cavern well after Frodo and sees only Frodo slip on the Ring — none of his hesitation to destroy it. The affair unfolds briskly from there, or perhaps it seems so when juxtaposed with the otherwise overwrought nature of Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s prose to that point. Indeed, the destruction of the Ring is communicated to the reader in just a few short sentences after Gollum bites off Frodo&amp;rsquo;s finger:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Precious, precious, precious!&amp;rsquo; Gollum cried. &amp;lsquo;My Precious! O my Precious!&amp;rsquo; And with that, even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and then with a shriek he fell. Out of the depths came his last wail &lt;em&gt;Precious&lt;/em&gt;, and he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am sure there is scholarship here on Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s choice in portraying the events — it certainly serves his other narrative themes to portray the actual &lt;em&gt;destruction&lt;/em&gt; of the Ring as relatively minor compared to the journey to get there. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s almost comedic in how quickly and ridiculously it unfolds: not with some grand act of courage — that part is already passed — but with the folly of Gollum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One familiar with the movies might think this the relative end of the major events of &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;. Not so for me: I knew &amp;ldquo;The Scouring of the Shire&amp;rdquo; to be an infamous literary anti-climax and was excited to at last polish of the series, so I dreaded the remaining pages. While elements of &amp;ldquo;The Scouring,&amp;rdquo; too, are ridiculous (Sharkey, mainly), and less intentionally so than Gollum&amp;rsquo;s demise, its thematic importance looms large: Frodo&amp;rsquo;s anti-hero&amp;rsquo;s journey (in the Campbellian sense). Instead of pursuing and gaining a treasure as the classic heroes do, Frodo&amp;rsquo;s journey is instead the &lt;em&gt;destruction&lt;/em&gt; of one. Does Frodo indeed achieve transformation into a better version of himself? &amp;ldquo;The Scouring of the Shire&amp;rdquo; explores what lies in the wake of war and victory, acknowledging the long process of rebuilding (on a macro-level, for Middle-earth as a whole) and rebirth (on a micro-level, for Frodo internally) that come after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Scouring echoes Odysseus&amp;rsquo;s return to Ithaca and slaughter of the suitors, in many ways, to reclaim his throne, his wife (which Frodo lacks because he is gay married to Sam), and his power, but where Odysseus enacts violent and bloody revenge, Frodo lays down all arms and implores others to do the same. Tolkien is not entirely committed to a pacifistic ideal, of course — that would be an inconsistent message after nearly 1000 pages of grand battles and acts of heroism on the battlefield. Frodo draws no blade, but Merry and Pippin do, which the narrative seems to acknowledge as a necessity in reclaiming the Shire. But while Odysseus&amp;rsquo;s brutality in reclaiming his kingdom is key to his ending — he shows his valor, even in old age and hardship, and corrects his earlier mistakes by working as an ally of the Gods — Frodo&amp;rsquo;s denouncement of revenge completes an idealistic vision of moral good: Frodo has witnessed and been tempted toward wretched, absolute power and rejected it for the placid, pastoral life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Frodo is also transformed from the trauma of his journey. From the Foreword of &lt;em&gt;Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; onward, I found ludicrous Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s dogged insistence that the books have nothing to do with his experiences in war or the cultural milieu in which they were written. Frodo&amp;rsquo;s trauma is the plainest acknowledgement of this influence. I do not pretend to know Tolkien, his life, or his biography, but Frodo&amp;rsquo;s anguish and inability to fully heal rings as one of the most realistic aspects of the series, grounding high fantasy in the painfully human. Even after the Shire is reclaimed, Frodo is haunted by all that he has seen and felt; he is ill and bedridden on the anniversaries of Weathertop and Mount Doom, psychosomatic (or perhaps mystical — this is &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, after all) anniversary reactions. This pairs beautifully with the hopeful and triumphant end of the Scouring episode: the reader experiences joy and celebration in seeing good and beauty restored to the Shire but catharsis through Frodo&amp;rsquo;s lasting emotional scars. The end of &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; is, in many ways, optimistic — Middle-earth is poised for a new age of rebirth — but it acknowledges the suffering and labor paid to realize that future. This is captured none better than when Frodo reveals to Sam that he will travel to the Grey Havens:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;But,&amp;rsquo; said Sam, and tears started in his eyes, &amp;lsquo;I thought you were going to enjoy the Shire, too, for years and years, after all you have done.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. &lt;strong&gt;I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me.&lt;/strong&gt; It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them&amp;hellip; keep alive the memory of the age that has gone, so that people will remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the more. And that will keep you busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your part of the Story goes on.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theme is therein laid bare: in the darkest of times, salvation is possible and can (must) be fought for. This salvation is bitterly won and leaves real, lasting scars, but we must endure for the sake of that which we love. It is a cost well worth paying — all 1008 pages of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;fuck J.K.

Of note also is that my brother and sister had severe fevers that day; my dad still took them to the multiplex for a four-hour movie.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By which I mean other contemporary children&amp;rsquo;s and young adult literature. I can remember a lot of nights staying up late reading &lt;em&gt;A Series of Unfortunate Events&lt;/em&gt;, Garth Nix&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Keys to the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; series, &lt;em&gt;Eragon,&lt;/em&gt; and so on.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Den, I forgive you.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder my brother had to constantly explain the plot and the lore to me while we watched the movies.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine my disappointment when I found that Legolas indeed did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; surf on an orc&amp;rsquo;s shield down a set of stairs during the Battle of Helm&amp;rsquo;s Deep in the books. I am since converted to a &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; sicko.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am proud to announce that I am a better reader in my late twenties and early thirties than I was at 10.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:10&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize I am opening myself to the censure of the Tolkien fandom with this. I understand the &lt;em&gt;textual&lt;/em&gt; importance of Bombadil, but I stand by that the experience of reading that chapter is drudgery. If you have strong feelings about this, please send your thoughts and complaints to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:idontgiveafuck@shoveitupyourass.com&#34;&gt;idontgiveafuck@shoveitupyourass.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:11&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, if you have strong feelings about this, see the previous footnote.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:12&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was probably around the same time that I was pretending to read &lt;em&gt;Villette.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:13&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May and June are my most hectic months as a teacher (aside from maybe September), so I was really only reading it in a concentrated fashion from late-June into July.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I moved domains, again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog started on bearblog.dev as cassie.land. Bearblog is a great platform, but I &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/what%27s-this-%28and-how-it-works%29/&#34;&gt;wanted a challenge in my life&lt;/a&gt;, I guess, so I taught myself to use Hugo and moved to esotericbullshit.net (cassie.land was repurposed for my NAS). I love the esotericbullshit moniker and URL — it makes me laugh — but as it turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of hard to share your link when it contains profanity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s copium for a growing domain purchasing addiction, but I intend to make this one stick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a long history with blogging. I posted on livejournal from 2007-2012 several times a week, with mundane accounts of my day and fragile mental state&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2013, I moved to a private Dreamwidth blog, and then to a WordPress blog in 2014. Each time I moved, I had the compulsion to backport all of my old writing, but I liked the idea of a fresh start — and I felt each time that I was a new, improved version of me with a distinct voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as I plumb through my livejournal archive, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized: wherever I go, I&amp;rsquo;m still myself. And that&amp;rsquo;s the impetus behind &lt;strong&gt;cassie.ink&lt;/strong&gt;: no bullshit, no hiding. It&amp;rsquo;s me and my name, and if I get sick of that, we have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I have the bravery to bring over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of that old content, but perhaps &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that will look like. I admire, for example, Jedda, whose &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.jeddacp.com/archive/?q=flashbackFriday&#34;&gt;flashbackFriday series&lt;/a&gt; unearths her teenage livejournal entries. Maybe the elegant solution is to backport some of the content with a warning that it&amp;rsquo;s old and I&amp;rsquo;m smarter and wiser and less fucking annoying now?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Import the old content but make it difficult (impossible) to access unless I link to it somewhere else? That&amp;rsquo;s all for me to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now — here I am, again, committing to blog, again.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this is not me censoring myself: I will continue to rampantly write fun words like fuck and shit&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m told that&amp;rsquo;s what the platform is for&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;most likely&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also understand hugo and git &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; better now — turns out that capriciously rebuilding your websites over and over again means you learn something!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve missed a few weeks, so consider this my catch up post before starting my week notes up again&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on migrating off big tech companies — I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted all my twitter accounts and am in the process of migrating from Google Photos to a self-hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://immich.app/&#34;&gt;immich&lt;/a&gt; service. Joe and I are also working on wiring up some of our house with ethernet: we&amp;rsquo;ve run cable the living room and plan to do the office next. I&amp;rsquo;ve also upgraded my server rack with a patch panel and managed switch (Aruba S2500). That will maybe become a big project post once we&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with the said, I needed a new phone and bought a Google Pixel Pro 9. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy being in Google&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem as much as I am, but there&amp;rsquo;s also no ethical consumption under global capitalism and I don&amp;rsquo;t want the bullshit bloatware other companies put on their Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve given up on &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; for now — it&amp;rsquo;s just not getting me excited to read. I started Daniel Handler&amp;rsquo;s memoir &lt;em&gt;And Then? And Then? What Else?&lt;/em&gt; — we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that treats me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I re-played &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/em&gt; with Joe watching; I&amp;rsquo;d been trying for years to get Joe to play it himself, but he stubbornly refused, saying he hated turn-based combat. There are now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasyxx2hdremaster/mods/228&#34;&gt;excellent mods out there&lt;/a&gt; to replace the busted HD remaster faces, and we have a working Steam Link setup to let us play PC games on the couch, so the time felt right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I loved the game just as much as when I&amp;rsquo;ve played it before. The world of Spira is still beautiful and dense and complicated with a soundtrack to match; every time the leitmotif kicks in, I feel both deeply sad and at home — which I think captures the feeling of Spira so well. Joe asked me which character was my favorite and I said I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure (it&amp;rsquo;s probably Yuna) because it really is an ensemble cast playing off of each other, each with their own backstory and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then the fucking &lt;em&gt;sorrow&lt;/em&gt;. This is such a sad game. It&amp;rsquo;s one that sat with me and lingered, even a good week after rolling credits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much I&amp;rsquo;ll dig into the endgame grinding and final bosses, but I&amp;rsquo;m also not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready to leave Spira behind just yet. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame there&amp;rsquo;s no other games set in the world for me to play.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://underscores.bandcamp.com/album/wallsocket&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wallsocket&lt;/em&gt; by underscores&lt;/a&gt; after really liking &lt;em&gt;fishmonger&lt;/em&gt;. It had some good moments, but on the whole, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Horsegirl&amp;rsquo;s full album, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thisishorsegirl.bandcamp.com/album/phonetics-on-and-on&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phonetics On and On&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dropped, and I really like it. &amp;ldquo;Information Content&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;2468&amp;rdquo; are the standouts to me. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to see them in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also listened to &lt;a href=&#34;https://afrolab9000.bandcamp.com/album/who-told-you-to-think&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;who told you to think??!!?!?!?!&lt;/em&gt; by Milo&lt;/a&gt;, which I found good not great (I really like &amp;ldquo;mrs&amp;rdquo; though), and I downloaded a few Car Seat Headrest albums to listen through. Back when I worked at Radioshack, my manager loved Car Seat Headrest, so we&amp;rsquo;d have them playing in the store quite often. I always liked their sound but just never dived into their discography (partly because it&amp;rsquo;s so fucking confusing). It felt like a good time to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this is, of course, a joke; I have never played &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X-2&lt;/em&gt; and have some pretty big feelings about some of the bullshit in that game. Maybe one day.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;

I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fields of Mistria&lt;/em&gt; and did some upgrades to the computers in my house — all three (my PC, Joe&amp;rsquo;s, and one hooked up to our TV) are AM4 builds, so I&amp;rsquo;m able to upgrade my PC and put the old parts into the others. We&amp;rsquo;re also planning and ordering equipment for our next big home project: wiring the living room and office with Cat6 ethernet and running down to a managed switch on the network rack. We made all of the purchases this week and plan to do the work over our February break.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I had a talk about something I&amp;rsquo;ve been rolling around in my head a lot lately — my inability to shut my brain off and enjoy things, my refusal to ever just commit to the moment. It&amp;rsquo;s maybe a topic for a longer post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally deleted my twitter account, which dates back to probably 2011 or 2012. I stopped using it in favor of Mastodon and Bluesky a long time ago, but I dragged my feet about actually pulling the trigger. I&amp;rsquo;m finally done. Elon Musk is a Nazi and I don&amp;rsquo;t fuck with that. I could delete Facebook without another thought, but I have a few friends who use Instagram &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; that I want to keep up with. With time, maybe, but this is a step in the right direction for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not touched &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; since reading the first twenty pages. Maybe back to back 19th century lit wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;. I think I really liked it? Season two went some bad (as in, poorly written and plotted) places, but so did season one I think — the first season was just a lot tighter and more cohesive. I&amp;rsquo;ve read some about the behind the scenes drama with the show, which sours me — the creator seems like a dick. Jules remains my favorite, and I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see where season three goes if it ever actually gets made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I have been watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PsjZ6qakyJY&#34;&gt;Vinny and Abby play &lt;em&gt;The Roottrees Are Dead&lt;/em&gt; on Nextlander&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like a neat game that I&amp;rsquo;d really enjoy playing, but I love Vinny and Abby&amp;rsquo;s dynamic too much to not watch it — and I think I&amp;rsquo;d need time to forget everything before I play it myself. The streams make me miss the golden days of Giant Bomb East&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been watching (with Joe on and off) &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe_AuQUfBKl6qEwkoLSlUXSCskcMEOKt0&#34;&gt;Into the Aether&amp;rsquo;s short-lived &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/em&gt; playthrough&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s reawakening my love for that game; I think I have convinced Joe to play through it with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Fields of Mistria&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve reached mid-fall and the bottom of the mines (for now). It might become a game I check in on when new updates come out, but I think what&amp;rsquo;s here is really, really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;em&gt;10000 gecs&lt;/em&gt; after really liking &lt;em&gt;1000 gecs&lt;/em&gt;. It was a disappointment personally; I admire experimentation and innovation, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t hit for me. It strayed too far from the goofy hyperpop that they did so well on &lt;em&gt;1000 gecs&lt;/em&gt;; it was too much of a genre mishmash that leaned too hard into absurdism for the sake of comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, who &lt;a href=&#34;https://nkbradio.bandcamp.com/album/another-summer&#34;&gt;made their own really sick hyperpop album&lt;/a&gt;, recommended that I check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://underscores.bandcamp.com/album/fishmonger&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fishmonger&lt;/em&gt; by underscores&lt;/a&gt;. I loved it. Maybe a perfect album.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

I took a fat nap in front of it on Friday night. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it took me this long to get one (I thought the were way more expensive than they actually are and that Joe was morally opposed to them for some reason).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on decreasing my use of big social media apps and focusing instead on indieweb spaces. I cut my Twitter habit a long time ago and only keep it around for Los Campesinos! updates (would love to see them move to another platform — seems incongruous with their politics that they&amp;rsquo;re still on there almost exclusively). I&amp;rsquo;m tapering off on Facebook and Instagram. I could delete my Facebook today without another thought, but I have a few friends on Instagram that aren&amp;rsquo;t active elsewhere that I&amp;rsquo;d hate to lose contact with — but that becomes less and less worth it to me as Meta continues to slide into active evil. I know this doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like someone trying to get off of social media, but as a once daily user of all these platforms, I&amp;rsquo;m making a lot of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, though, the depression and anhedonia are continuing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to go to the gym whenever I feel desperate and lost because at least then I&amp;rsquo;m doing something healthy &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; feeling desperate and lost, but the horrors persist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, ashamed of having yet another week note with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; still in progress, I finally sat (laid) down and finished off the last twenty pages. I love the book just as much (maybe more? is this recency bias speaking?) as I did years ago and feel once again confident calling it one of my favorite books. Next up is Brontë&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; — I haven&amp;rsquo;t cracked the cover yet despite carrying it around with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continuing on with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m undecided on it. Maybe I was a loser in high school&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but these plotlines seem absurd (and gross and exploitative) for sixteen year olds. I also think some of the characters&amp;rsquo; motivations and actions — particularly Nate&amp;rsquo;s — make absolutely no sense. There are also plot threads that dominate the show but then seem to be abandoned; in general, I just feel there&amp;rsquo;s a few too many characters that the show is split between. Regardless, though, I still feel compelled to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fields of Mistria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and have been playing that. Joe and I have kept up with Mistria Mondays on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/c/FriendsattheTable&#34;&gt;Friends at the Table&lt;/a&gt;, and he started playing it a few weeks ago. I&amp;rsquo;m still very early on in it. I like it, but it has yet to fill me with the same joy and wonder that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; did. I do think it&amp;rsquo;s a little unfair that it is constantly compared to &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; — it should be allowed to exist and be discussed on its own merits, and &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; is far from the first to do a lot of what it does — but the comparison is sort of inevitable. &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; saw me through a pretty intense period of depression years ago, so I think I sought out &lt;em&gt;Mistria&lt;/em&gt; for the same reasons.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying out, when I got to the gym to run, listening through entire albums. So far it&amp;rsquo;s been just ones I know I love (Mac Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;GO:OD AM&lt;/em&gt; and Bloc Party&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;). I need to listen to music when I run to keep my mind distracted, but my gym playlists get stale so quickly. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this works for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I heard Laura Les&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Haunted&amp;rdquo; on an episode of &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt; and really loved it — it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome pull for Jules&amp;rsquo;s character. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had contact with &lt;strong&gt;100 gecs&lt;/strong&gt; despite being the target audience for them. I downloaded &lt;em&gt;1000 gecs&lt;/em&gt; to listen to and generally enjoyed it; it&amp;rsquo;s a weird album and one I&amp;rsquo;d definitely have to be in the mood for — not really stuff I could play on car rides with friends. Regardless, though, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a fucking cool album — big nightcore AMV vibes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is probably worth noting that, on my second listen through, my audio interface fucked up and was outputting everything with a distorted static and I sort of just assumed that was how the album sounded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know I was, but if being &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a loser means being involved in the shit these kids get into, then I&amp;rsquo;m glad to be a loser.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would not say I am intensely depressed right now, but seasonal depression is real and I probably have it and also Trump is president again so who isn&amp;rsquo;t?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I recently discovered some weirdness with my hard drives in my PC. It&amp;rsquo;s a long story that isn&amp;rsquo;t worth telling, but the end of it is that I bought an NVMe drive and am starting fresh with a clean install of Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly painless now that I have a drive that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; my files with a separate OS drive. I do have to reinstall and set up some apps again, but it has been a good opportunity to reassess the cruft I&amp;rsquo;ve let build up on there over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went to the gym for the first time in a long time. A friend wants to join and get into the routine, so I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that I can latch on to that momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m unfortunately glued to the news and despairing about the incoming presidency. I was never on TikTok (an intentional choice), but this whole ridiculous saga has emphasized to me the importance of having a space on the internet I own and control. I&amp;rsquo;ve got plans for a direction I want my site to take, but all in time&amp;hellip; For now, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to have this. Larger than that, though, I&amp;rsquo;m terrified for what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m something like twenty pages from the end of &lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;. I need to just sit down and finish it, but work has been so hectic. I&amp;rsquo;ve let that become an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had some friends over and played &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YARG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with them. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have a backup and potential replacement for &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; as it is no longer maintained and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I see myself buying another home console ever (&lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; is the only thing I turn my PS4 on for these days). I&amp;rsquo;m a little disappointed that many of the fan-made charts out there are only for guitar, but there&amp;rsquo;s still a great library to select from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I played a little &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vampire Survivors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for the first time in a long time; it&amp;rsquo;s easy to pick up after months (years?) away, and it might be a good replacement for idle scrolling on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I listened to Mac Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; all the way through, I think for the first time since it released, after a friend became hyperfixated on &amp;ldquo;Right&amp;rdquo; (which I had not heard yet — I never listened to the bonus tracks for the deluxe release). I had such mixed feelings about it when it came out. It&amp;rsquo;s the first posthumous release I&amp;rsquo;ve ever really &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; about, and it just didn&amp;rsquo;t grab me. I think it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like an authentic Mac release; I don&amp;rsquo;t hold any ill will for anyone involved, and I think his family has handled his estate respectfully, but it was missing something — but then, it was intended to be a new, different direction for Mac. Regardless, I wanted to see how I felt years on, so I jotted feelings down track-by-track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Circles&amp;rdquo; - I&amp;rsquo;ve loved this song from the jump. I heard a leaked version months before the release was announced and adored it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Complicated&amp;rdquo; - The synths in this song are so bad, and the pitched up ab libs are awful. It feels like if someone else tried to make a Mac song and imitate Delusional Thomas features.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blue World&amp;rdquo; - I like it more than I remember, but it is a little grating.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good News&amp;rdquo; - A good song. I loved it when I first heard it, but it&amp;rsquo;s grown stale for me. This is probably the song I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to someone who wants to get into Mac but isn&amp;rsquo;t big on rap.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Can See&amp;rdquo; - Again, the synths! They&amp;rsquo;re awful. They sound like a jrpg hotel track and not in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everybody&amp;rdquo; - Another I like more than I recall. I like hearing Mac sing, but there&amp;rsquo;s something bland in the instrumentation and production. It&amp;rsquo;s a refined but dry track.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Woods&amp;rdquo; - I love &amp;ldquo;Woods.&amp;rdquo; I think it&amp;rsquo;s my favorite on the album.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hand Me Downs&amp;rdquo; - Probably the most reminiscent of Mac&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; sound. Despite that, it&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite; I like the Mac parts but not whoever is featured on it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s On Me&amp;rdquo; - Awful and repetitive; can&amp;rsquo;t stand it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hands&amp;rdquo; - Fine, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen to it unless I was making it a point to listen through the entire album.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Surf&amp;rdquo; - This is probably my most listened to song from the album. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, but it works.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once a Day&amp;rdquo; - Another I like more than I remember. I think I like &lt;em&gt;Circles&lt;/em&gt; most when it&amp;rsquo;s pared down, simple tracks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right&amp;rdquo; - I really like this one. The drums are sick.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Floating&amp;rdquo; - No real feelings.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It really is a pop album (hot take: a pop album for old people). I admire how Mac always experimented and evolved his sound — this direction just wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Balloonerism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was released this week. I&amp;rsquo;d heard all but two songs through listening to leaks, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t hold any great surprises for me, but I love it still — it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastically weird, experimental little project that has some of my favorite Mac songs on it (namely, &amp;ldquo;Do You Have a Destination?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Excelsior&amp;rdquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful to hear the tracks properly mastered and to assuage some of my guilt about listening to leaks, but it&amp;rsquo;s bittersweet, too: this feels pretty definitively like the last proper Mac release we will see aside from some bonus tracks and loosies on anniversary editions (please give me &amp;ldquo;He Finally Sleeps&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pure&amp;rdquo; 🙏). &lt;em&gt;Blue Slide Park&lt;/em&gt; aside (it&amp;rsquo;s about the progress, the journey!), I think Mac was an incredible artist with so much still left to share when he passed. It&amp;rsquo;s good to hear his voice and fresh songs, but they always linger with loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A coworker also recommended &lt;strong&gt;The New Pornographers&lt;/strong&gt; to me; I listened to a few songs from &lt;em&gt;Twin Cinema&lt;/em&gt; and found them aggressively fine, but I think perhaps I don&amp;rsquo;t have headspace for anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t Mac right now. I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the album and give &lt;em&gt;Mass Romantic&lt;/em&gt; a shot some other time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I had a friend over one evening for pizza and card games — mostly Fan Tan and Blackjack, which are almost the only card games I like. My volleyball rec league started up again this week; I haven&amp;rsquo;t made time for physical exercise lately, and volleyball is a good commitment. I&amp;rsquo;d like to start running again soon too, but I&amp;rsquo;m nursing a minor foot injury that I&amp;rsquo;d like to see cleared up before I put too much stress on it. Thursday was the school spelling bee, which is both fun and heart-wrenching to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I went out to dinner on Friday at a restaurant we love. We&amp;rsquo;re not a &amp;ldquo;date night&amp;rdquo; couple, but he suggested going out and it was really nice — we haven&amp;rsquo;t really made time recently to do things just the two of us. It was a good way to end the week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading &lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;, still, and am still loving it — I just haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to read with going back to school this week. I&amp;rsquo;m almost done, though, and I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to read &lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt; by Charlotte Brontë next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To close out my viewing of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sQY0F_ioh6Q&#34;&gt;Princess Weekes&amp;rsquo;s thoughtful and well-rounded analysis of it&lt;/a&gt;. I generally agree with a lot of what she&amp;rsquo;s said. I think the racial politics and whiteness of the show sucks, and while I think Lena is somewhat correct in her defense that she wrote from her own experience and would not perhaps be able to authentically write characters of color, that all could easily have been solved by just having a more diverse writing staff. Lena deserves much of the flack she gets, but I also think Weekes is correct that that ire should also be directed to the studio execs who do not prioritize diversity — as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is far from the only show to have had this problem (even though it became the lightning rod for it, for both good and bad faith reasons).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;em&gt;form without content&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;luminism&lt;/strong&gt; after hearing a song of theirs on &lt;em&gt;YARG&lt;/em&gt;. The album as a whole wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me, &lt;a href=&#34;https://luminism.bandcamp.com/track/poser-2&#34;&gt;but I like &amp;ldquo;poser&amp;rdquo; a lot&lt;/a&gt;. It feels like a song I&amp;rsquo;d have loved when I was 13, which is a rare sort of nostalgia for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying out doing my week notes without the big headings. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what I land on as a format!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still reading &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but with the hubbub of the holidays, I haven&amp;rsquo;t made much progress. I&amp;rsquo;m excited about the next books in my pile, though, so I am determined to finish soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve burned through several seasons of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; since my last week notes. I&amp;rsquo;m in the last season now, and my opinions have started to solidify. I think if I&amp;rsquo;d watched the show at the time of airing, I&amp;rsquo;d have found Lena et al. insufferably pretentious. Old age has softened me; instead I find it a charming (though still deeply problematic and limited in the perspectives it represents) contra point. TV was and is rife with the male perspective, shows at which many of the same critiques could be levied (&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Always Sunny&lt;/em&gt;, etc.). I think &lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt; attracts the ire it does partly due to its creator&amp;rsquo;s frequent gaffes and problematic statements but also because it challenges the status quo simply by its existence and its featuring complex women who are hard to like. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there was a cultural crisis of any kind over the characters in shows like &lt;em&gt;Always Sunny&lt;/em&gt; being unlikeable — it&amp;rsquo;s clear that they&amp;rsquo;re meant to be. &lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt; is the same, but our culture has far more trouble swallowing unlikeable women. I also think that, while the show has its ups and downs and some storylines that don&amp;rsquo;t work, it is pretty consistent in quality — something I don&amp;rsquo;t often say about shows that run for several seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I have been playing lots of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satisfactory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve reached Tier 6 but are focused on redoing / optimizing old supply lines and completing the FICSMAS event before we get into oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I downloaded &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Well I Fell Into&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by WHY? after listening to a bunch of &lt;em&gt;Alopecia&lt;/em&gt; over the last few weeks. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to make it through for some reason. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;ve turned it off because I don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but none of it really grabs me, save for &amp;ldquo;Marigold,&amp;rdquo; which I absolutely love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the midst of a pretty bad flair up of seasonal depression, so these week notes are brief and hastily cobbled together. I missed a week over the holidays though and I want to be more consistent in 2025. I see lots of folks compiling yearly wrap ups and resolutions, but I&amp;rsquo;m struggling with basic tasks like getting out of bed and eating right now. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to make myself sound all desperate and pathetic, to garner sympathy or to attract pity — but I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to be honest about mental health. Please know that I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with this for a long time and it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of riding it out; my depression never manifests to suicidal ideation and very rarely self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

The trouble is that I genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t know what I did to it! This week is my last before our holiday break, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get back on the horse over the course of my 16 (!!) days off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/12/stoptalking.png&#34; alt=&#34;a painting of a black cat, wide eyed, with a speech bubble that reads &amp;ldquo;stop talking&amp;rdquo;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I briefly contemplated &lt;a href=&#34;https://20x200.com/products/stop-talking?variant=10674962884&#34;&gt;spending far too much money on a print of Martha Rich&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Stop Talking,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m far too poor and cheap, even though it expertly captures how I feel lately after work (or  interacting with anyone).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in a strange headspace since turning 30. I feel as though I know myself and the world so much better now, like it&amp;rsquo;s time to stop wasting all &lt;em&gt;my time&lt;/em&gt; on the bullshit and focus instead on what&amp;rsquo;s really important to me. I have been reflecting on myself a lot lately, but in a present- and future-oriented way: what is it I want to be doing? What really fucking matters? These questions sound quite existential and they are, but they&amp;rsquo;re also oddly liberating — and it&amp;rsquo;s driving me to read more and (hopefully) write again. It all feels like coming back home after a long trip, taking comfort and finding peace and joy in the known and loved familiar.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still (re-)reading &lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m just as in love with it as ever. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s revisionist history on my part, but I feel I understand the humor, the plot, the politic far more this time around — but then, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking back at the past and thinking I&amp;rsquo;ve grown far older and wiser since when perhaps only the former is true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I finished the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; mini-series that we started last week; I&amp;rsquo;d seen it before and found it similarly delightful this time around, though I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to doubt my prior assertions that &lt;em&gt;Emma&lt;/em&gt; is Austen&amp;rsquo;s work (albeit not my personal favorite). Perhaps a re-read is in order&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also continuing on with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; I&amp;rsquo;m actually enjoying it now (still in season one). There&amp;rsquo;s some really funny shit in it, but most of the dramatic beats fall short for me. I find Hannah generally insufferable, Adam I&amp;rsquo;m up and down on, I love what little Shoshanna there is, I&amp;rsquo;m tepid on Jessa, and I like Marnie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thisishorsegirl.bandcamp.com/track/2468&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;2468&amp;rdquo; by Horsegirl.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A random find while stumbling around Bandcamp, but I&amp;rsquo;m in love.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Intricate Inner Workings of the System,&lt;/em&gt; The Bug Club.&lt;/strong&gt; Pleasant listening but a bit humdrum; few standouts for me as there have been on their other albums.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alopecia,&lt;/em&gt; WHY?&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to &amp;ldquo;Good Friday,&amp;rdquo; mainly, and sampling other tracks here and there for years. For some reason I had a line from &amp;ldquo;These Few Presidents&amp;rdquo; in my head this week — &amp;ldquo;even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen you for years, yours is a funeral I&amp;rsquo;d run to from anywhere&amp;rdquo; — and it prompted me to at last listen to the album all the way through. I have since been (figuratively) spinning and shuffling it through the week. I&amp;rsquo;ve not listened to any others of WHY?&amp;rsquo;s albums — I get the impression they&amp;rsquo;re variable in quality — but I may give them a shot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to my friends: I&amp;rsquo;m sorry (no I&amp;rsquo;m not) for all the hand-wringing I did leaving up to this birthday only to, a month in, be singing 30&amp;rsquo;s praises&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I love esotericbullshit, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s the energy I want to put out there. It makes the URL a little hard to share. But it also feels remarkably stupid when I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; moved this over from another domain (which is incidentally quite similar to the new one&amp;hellip;).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I went to bar trivia with some friends. We had a good time! I used to go frequently, but it usually conflicts with my volleyball rec league, so it&amp;rsquo;s fallen by the wayside. The league is between seasons now though, and we liked the theme, so we made our triumphant&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; return.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent Saturday braving crowds at the mall&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in an attempt at holiday shopping. I think I ended up spending more on myself than on others. The holiday gift exchange has felt more and more ridiculous each of the last few years. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m becoming more cynical and tired of capitalism as I age (I had thought the remedy there would be to shop local, and I did, but I still had folks on my list). Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a natural shift in adulthood — all my friends and family members are adults with lives and houses (or apartments) and income to buy themselves what they want. Gift exchanges then become the trading of useless trinkets to which the recipient has the most tenuous of connections. I used to love buying gifts for people; it used to feel like an exhilarating challenge to find something charmingly specific to them. Now it just feels like a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to read &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woman Hollering Creek and other stories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Sandra Cisneros (from last week). I really loved &amp;ldquo;Never Marry a Mexican&amp;rdquo;; many of the early stories are told from the perspective of a child or a teen. Cisneros excels here (see &lt;em&gt;Mango Street&lt;/em&gt;), but it becomes a little exhausting; &amp;ldquo;Never Marry&amp;rdquo; was a welcome break. Some of the stories run long, though, and can begin to feel repetitive — but then, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re meant to marathon through this but rather read stories here and there from the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my purchases for myself while holiday shopping was a new paperback copy of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In late high school, I read it for the first time, and I spent the next few years reading it again and again. My old copy is worn, an odd size, and technically stolen from my mother, so while I wait for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dead Father&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to come into my local bookstore, I have started re-reading &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&amp;amp;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time in almost a decade. I&amp;rsquo;m quite early in, but I am glad to report that I love it still.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve convinced Joe to watch the 2009 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; mini-series with me. I am hoping to leverage this into him consuming more Austen media with me, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clueless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which he has never seen despite it being one of my favorite movies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also started watching &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for reasons that I cannot fully explain. I think I&amp;rsquo;m just puzzled by it; I hear folks complain about how shamelessly self-centered and insipid it is and then in the same breath discuss it as a cultural touchstone. I suppose I wanted to see for myself. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how far I will make it; the first few episodes have had little humor or draw for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: I already bought the new one, so I should just do what I want and chase whatever feels natural and authentic to me in this moment. But I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; also think it&amp;rsquo;s important to maintain some sense of permanency, as I don&amp;rsquo;t want this to be just another web project that I abandon. I admire the folks who have been blogging at the same site for a decade (even more so if they&amp;rsquo;ve left all that legacy content up); I tend to grow self-conscious a year or more on and delete, forget, abandon. So why not commit to the choice I&amp;rsquo;ve made — even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, maybe it will tomorrow? Or should I chase what inspires and just set up redirects&amp;hellip;? Discuss. (By which I mean send me an email if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been caught in this conundrum; like Fleabag, I think I just want someone to tell me what to do, right now and in general.)&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;second place&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am part of the problem&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;am I retreating into past favorites in reaction to Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election and a bleak, desperate future? explain your answer in a response of at least four sentences&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

The track itself is quite short, so the run is a little awkward, but it&amp;rsquo;s a super soft flooring which made the run easy on my joints. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a new run buddy, too!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saturday I felt angry and sick and exhausted all day; I&amp;rsquo;d intended to go out and do holiday shopping but instead just rotted at home. I know I needed the rest, but seemingly everything put me in a bad mood. It&amp;rsquo;s maybe just PMS — I haven&amp;rsquo;t been good about tracking my cycle lately, though — or just the seasonal depression. It&amp;rsquo;s shit no matter what it is.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lanadelrue.bearblog.dev/hometown-visit&#34;&gt;Hometown Visit&lt;/a&gt;.

This fits the bill; I love &lt;em&gt;Mango Street&lt;/em&gt; dearly and this simply feels like more of it (albeit not following one character, but then, Cisneros&amp;rsquo;s stories all seem to co-exist).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/owala-freesip-review/&#34;&gt;25 Wirecutter Journalists Can’t Be Wrong: How Owala Became an Official Water Bottle Pick&lt;/a&gt;. What a ridiculously self-important, self-absorbed article. I generally like and use Wirecutter; some of their recommendations are ridiculously decadent and detached from reality, but they are one of the few reliable online sources for product reviews and recommendations. I am all for an ode to something you love and that makes your life better, but this read not as &amp;ldquo;we tested and compared a lot of products&amp;rdquo; but more &amp;ldquo;we all have good taste and have this water bottle so it must be good, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9OhTB5eBqQ&#34;&gt;Evermore: The Theme Park That Wasn&amp;rsquo;t - YouTube&lt;/a&gt; by Jenny Nicholson.&lt;/strong&gt; I love Jenny&amp;rsquo;s videos but hadn&amp;rsquo;t watched this one yet; I dozed through portions but enjoyed it all the same.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice The Board Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

I enjoyed the time I put into it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will go back to it.

        &lt;p&gt;Since I &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/what%27s-this-%28and-how-it-works%29/&#34;&gt;moved this site to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an app called GitJournal to post from my phone. I have a beautiful desk setup with a clacky mechanical keyboard that&amp;rsquo;s a joy to write on, but the simple fact is that I&amp;rsquo;m a lazy shit and want to update my blog from the couch. It&amp;rsquo;s all mostly worked fine, with some headaches. I originally intended to use GitJournal to store my Github repo to my phone&amp;rsquo;s filesystem and then point an Obsidian&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; vault at that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, GitJournal currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal/issues/925&#34;&gt;cannot store the repo&lt;/a&gt; in the Android filesystem due to a permissions issue, so I can&amp;rsquo;t use it with Obsidian. GitJournal&amp;rsquo;s note-taking app is serviceable, but again, I want to use Obsidian. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making-do with GitJournal for a few months now — for once in my life, not fixing what&amp;rsquo;s broken — operating under the assumption that there were no other options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to repeat myself: I am a lazy shit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am now using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync&#34;&gt;GitSync&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s dead simple: you sign in with your Github account, select the repo you want to clone to your device, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. Critically for me, however, it has a setting to automatically sync the repo when you open and close certain apps — for me, Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/2024/gitsync.png&#34; alt=&#34;GitSync screenshot&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the beauty of GitSync: it stays out of my way. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s configured, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to open it or think about it. I open Obsidian, write my silly little posts, close Obsidian, and I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone should have their own space on the web, and there are great tools out there like &lt;a href=&#34;https://bearblog.dev&#34;&gt;bearblog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pika.page/&#34;&gt;Pika&lt;/a&gt; and so on. But I&amp;rsquo;m tired of hoping platforms and losing content: I want to own my space and what I write. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot and I generally have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing&lt;/strong&gt;, so if you&amp;rsquo;re of a similar mind to me but daunted by the concept of creating your own website, shoot me an email. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert, but I can at least share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and what I&amp;rsquo;ve set up: a way to run your own website but really just type shit in a note-taking app.  Simple and frictionless.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obsidian is currently my preferred app for writing on my phone and on my PC. I&amp;rsquo;m not really using it as a knowledge management system like some people (although I would like to maybe move my Notion database of lesson and unit plans over to it), and I&amp;rsquo;m only currently using two plugins with it majorly, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/about&#34;&gt;its ethos aligns with mine&lt;/a&gt; for what an app should be.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;that is, unless you like to incessantly poke at shit and tinker like me, and then things change and break. but the posting, the posting is simple.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

My time was not good (40:38), but there was wet, heavy snow coming down, so I was mostly focused on not eating shit. I think mid-November might be my 5K cutoff. We otherwise stayed home for the holiday and spent some much needed time relaxing together.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With the holiday season upon us, this is usually around the time that I take a big trip out to a nearby mall to get gifts for everyone. I want to commit this year to shopping mostly (entirely?) from local small businesses or buying handmade and secondhand goods. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to live in a town with a great Main Street, and I want to stop dumping my money into corporations.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I did order a bunch of rechargeable batteries from Amazon for Black Friday, but that was the extent of my shopping.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I miss podcasting again. I&amp;rsquo;ve run a few podcasts over the years, which all petered out for various reasons, but I&amp;rsquo;m feeling the itch again. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;d podcast about, though, which runs contrary to popular logic: you should have something to say, not just the desire to say things. I love audio production and the sound of my own voice, though.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maybe I record audio versions of my blog posts and turn that into a podcast? I want to write more, after all. I don&amp;rsquo;t think my week notes would be conducive to an audio format, but maybe my longer form writing (what little of it exists).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I bought a camera (Panasonic Lumix G7) on a bit of a whim. I film a lot of videos for my school, so I guess there&amp;rsquo;s professional utility in using something other than my phone, but I also want to get better about taking pictures to preserve memories.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, I felt sick and rotted on the couch and watched YouTube junkfood: mostly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@outsidexbox&#34;&gt;outsidexbox&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s seven things videos and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@MachoNachoProductions&#34;&gt;Macho Nacho&lt;/a&gt; console mod videos.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mod consoles. I like to tinker with electronics, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never soldered anything. Somehow, however, I find myself watching a lot of these sorts of videos. I think I admire the production value and Tito&amp;rsquo;s calm, measured approach.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about done with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched the movies yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/em&gt; by John Krakauer.&lt;/strong&gt; As a kid, the film adaptation was on frequent rotation in my house; my mom often fixated on one movie and watched it over and over, and she was a big fan of the soundtrack as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to read the book since, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying again to commit to reading more now that the start of school year frenzy has died down for me. I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying following McCandless&amp;rsquo;s story and don&amp;rsquo;t think Krakauer too effusive (though his biases are clear), but some of the tangents feel extraneous.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finished on November 28.&lt;/strong&gt; A humanizing and sympathetic account of a controversial figure. A few meandering chapters, but there are — in McCandless&amp;rsquo;s case especially — wrong turns taken in pursuit of truth, meaning, and beauty.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered Charlotte Brontë&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Villette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; through my local bookstore as an upcoming read on the recommendation of a student&amp;rsquo;s parent. I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in getting my hands on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dead Father&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by David Barthelme after reading an excerpt in &lt;em&gt;Into the Wild.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satisfactory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few months before the pandemic, while I was in grad school, I fell deeply in love with &lt;em&gt;Satisfactory&lt;/em&gt; and attempted in vain to explain to my literary and well-rounded colleagues that I was spending my free time balancing my iron production pipelines and converting from biomass energy to coal. I dipped my toe in a few more times after my mania but resolved to wait until 1.0 as many of my production lines would need to be seriously re-tooled. Joe suggested we start a co-op save this week and I am back and thriving.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We did get into a brief, heated conflict over manifold (my preference) versus balanced production, an argument all couples experience at some point in their relationship, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I played a little but more of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Crystal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m at a point where I have to grind out levels to take on the next gym, which I&amp;rsquo;m supremely uninterested in doing. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just hack my save.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I downloaded the &lt;em&gt;Satisfactory&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack and have had that on in the background — it&amp;rsquo;s very good. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly still listening to &lt;strong&gt;Rainbow Kitten Surprise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;first week notes in a while so some of this might not be strictly &amp;ldquo;this week&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I turned 30. I had a big party with lots of friends — and I feel grateful to have so many folks who want to celebrate with me, including some who drove substantial distances. I still have a bunch of mixed up feelings about crossing this threshold, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember the advice of a friend: it&amp;rsquo;s a gift to grow older.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This maybe belongs under a playing heading, but maybe not: I picked up &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time since the pandemic. It&amp;rsquo;s getting to be too cold out to run, so I need an alternate fitness option. My most reliable gym buddy moved away, so I&amp;rsquo;m seeing if I can get &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit&lt;/em&gt; to stick again. I am definitely in way better shape than when I was playing years ago; I would feel faint after 20-30 minutes in the game, but my first session was over 30 minutes and I felt fine (albeit sweaty) after. Turning 30 feels like an inflection point where I need to get serious about losing weight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I also went to the gym for the first time in months to run on the treadmill. With snow season upon us, I need to transition to indoor running. I like it quite a bit less, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose progress.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We had our first big snow of the season on Friday, which meant a (much-needed) lazy snow day at home.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daria&lt;/em&gt;, season four.&lt;/strong&gt; I started rewatching Daria around Halloween because I dressed as her for the holiday.

I know a lot of my love for Gen 2 stems from it being my first Pokémon — and, indeed, one of the first &lt;em&gt;games&lt;/em&gt; I really ever played — but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that it&amp;rsquo;s just as charming as I remember.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rainbow Kitten Surprise, &lt;em&gt;RKS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Listened on the recommendation of a friend; I was concerned initially because I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like the first track (my words: &amp;ldquo;Big garage vibes. Like shit you listen to while you work on your motorcycle&amp;rdquo;), but after that hump, I really loved the album. My tops are &amp;ldquo;Cold Love,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Wasted,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;All&amp;rsquo;s Well That Ends,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Lady Lie.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Cold Love&amp;rdquo; in particular has really hung around in my head.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Reflections on elections</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;2016 was the first year I was eligible to vote in a presidential election. I was away at college, so I completed an absentee ballot, and, like most, felt confident in what I thought would be the result. I was no big fan of Clinton&amp;rsquo;s — I voted for Bernie in the primaries — but the other option was laughable: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that a major political party put such a clown up as their candidate, and I thought the electorate was smart enough to see him for the fraud (and fascist) he was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the night of Tuesday, November 8th, I had a Diversity in Education class at 5:30pm. I enjoyed the class; it was mostly discussion-based, encouraging future educators to consider how they might be more inclusive and equitable in their practices. The curriculum was not as aggressive as I might have liked — I had cut my teeth as a teen on leftist circles of tumblr, so by comparison, the concept of considering diversity beyond celebrating and recognizing Black History Month was pretty banal. Even so, I was glad to be in a room with (mostly) like-minded people eager to make kids feel seen and hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The class was held in my college&amp;rsquo;s education building, which was built partially into a hill. The front of the building is a stunning wall of open windows that frame the mountain-facing campus. At the rear of the building, where my class met, we had no windows — and, critically, no cell reception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The twenty of us entered our silo unbothered, calm, sure of the forthcoming election results. Like most of our class meetings, there was an energy of optimism: we were all excited to begin our careers as teachers; believed we would inspire real social change by raising conscientious, justice-oriented young people; envisioned beginning our adult lives under the first female president, albeit a problematic white lady. Progress, even though it was slow, felt possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An hour and a half into class, we were let out on a short break — people splintered off to use the restroom, grab something from the vending machines, stretch their legs, and check their phones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mood instantaneously soured as we lit up our screens and laid witness to the dismal reality. Smiling faces became shocked and grave. Our professor fruitlessly tried to pull us back together, but eventually acknowledged that we could never pivot back to where we had been. From here, there was no going back. We fed each other election copium, insisted that this was only a red mirage, that the needle would tick left as the night went on. We ended class early, and we exited that room different people than when we had first gone in. I walked back to my car, panicked and dejected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To borrow a cliche, I woke up the next morning absolutely certain that I was caught in a dream — that I had imagined the night before and was waking in a world where, in a few short months, a woman would lead the country. With mixed hesitation and optimism, I reached to the TV tray I was using as a nightstand, woke up my phone, and was yanked into the new reality before me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year, my partner and I voted early, and as we walked out of the polling place, he remarked, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to jinx anything, but we might have just voted for the first black woman president.&amp;rdquo; I waffled, not out of superstition but from experience. I had learned to be careful with my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Election day came around like a blur; I almost forgot it was a scheduled date, having voted almost two weeks before. I stayed away from news reports, early polling; I heard rumblings from some about Ann Selzer and young voter turnout and bomb threats, but I mentally enforced my 2016 bomb shelter: no phone, no election news, no gossip with coworkers. I needed to get through the school day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the way home, I stopped at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house to pick up some donations she had for my school&amp;rsquo;s GSA. We kept it light; the first polls hadn&amp;rsquo;t closed yet, so there was nothing much to say beyond speculation. Her husband&amp;rsquo;s words echoed my partner&amp;rsquo;s: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s still early to tell, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to jinx anything, but early polls look good.&amp;rdquo; I hoped he was right, but I resisted optimism. Hope doesn&amp;rsquo;t change a coin flip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mental state deteriorated as I went home. A friend messaged me in panic around 6:30, but I told her it was way too early to react. I went about my normal routine — shower, eat dinner, spend time with my cats — but I finally couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist any more. I looked at my phone. I saw the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I browsed the internet frenetically, looking for any salve internet pundits could offer. When I saw Pennsylvania with 85% of votes counted, I knew the race was sealed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days have passed. I feel the same: emotionally distraught, unable to focus on my work, simmering rage, immeasurable grief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mourn for my loved ones: my trans brother; my friend with undocumented parents; my friend who has struggled with infertility and miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mourn for my future: the children I want to have but now question — how can I responsibly, ethically, lovingly bring a child into &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mourn for the career that I love, that challenges children to think for themselves, to question authority, to collaborate with each other — all of which will come under attack in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mourn for my students, twelve years old and without hope that there is a good world waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mourn for the people placed in real, present danger by the hate of the coming administration — the deportations; the genocide; the lack of access to health care, housing, food; the worldwide dominos knocked backward into fascism by the bumbling hands of a barely-lucid fascist and a self-interested, deluded, resentful electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had words about continuing the fight, about not losing hope. Right now, the grief is too much.  Four years sounds easy, but this is a lifetime of Supreme Court appointments. Damage is swift, explosive; repair takes generations. Right now, it all feels like too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

Emotionally, I still feel like I was in their spot not that long ago — and then I remember I graduated over six years ago (and into a vastly different world and job market).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself using ellipses a lot and I do not like it. Is this growing old? Am I becoming a boomer?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about maintaining some kind of daily log — just simple, passing notes on what I did, what I thought about. Obsidian has this feature built in and it might be a good way to start. I like the idea of it being searchable and (theoretically) infinite in size, but I also want an excuse for another notebook.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I used to do daily reflections at the end of my work day. Slowly, those became every few days, then every week, then rarely. It was a good practice that I wish I had maintained, but there&amp;rsquo;s already so much I&amp;rsquo;m packing into my work day — and my goal in daily notes is to be more mindful about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and thinking in my free time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I attended my state-wide English teacher conference; this is something like my sixth or seventh time attending and I still find it valuable. I left with a lot of great ideas on how to diversify my practice and better empower my students.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson and the Olympians.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Joe and I have watched a few episodes. I liked the book fine, but the TV show has yet to grab me. It lacks Percy&amp;rsquo;s narrative voice (and personality), and while it&amp;rsquo;s good that Percy is played by an actual child, his pre-pubescent voice freaks me out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Joe and I watched a lot of &lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt; early in our relationship, but we never finished it. We are starting it over from the beginning. Still funny!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charli XCX, &lt;em&gt;Brat and it&amp;rsquo;s completely different but also still brat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Every re-release and new drop for &lt;em&gt;brat&lt;/em&gt; innovates, co-exists, and complements. The features on this remix album feel like an ode to the remarkable original release and a statement of how pivotal the album has been personally and for the industry writ large. This version of &amp;ldquo;Everything is romantic&amp;rdquo; is as much a remix as an iteration; the original captures a single moment in beautiful, mimetic detail, and this one is another artist following the theme and form with their own experiences. &lt;em&gt;brat&lt;/em&gt; is undoubtedly a project we&amp;rsquo;ll all be talking about when we discuss the music of the 2020s; I love witnessing its creation in real time.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the haters, a friend of mine said the mixing was bad and that it &amp;ldquo;just sounds like noise.&amp;rdquo; I still like her (Charli and the friend, in that order&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foxholes, &lt;em&gt;Foxholes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I found &amp;ldquo;Alligator&amp;rdquo; while going through Daytrotter archives and loved it; the rest of the album is pleasant listening, but &amp;ldquo;Alligator&amp;rdquo; is the stand out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yung Lean, &lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I loved Yung Lean&amp;rsquo;s feature on &lt;em&gt;Brat and it&amp;rsquo;s completely different but also still brat&lt;/em&gt;; imagine my surprise when I discovered that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgrSjynPKs&amp;amp;pp=ygUJeXVuZyBsZWFu&#34;&gt;the esoteric bullshit (or so I thought) I was listening to ten+ years ago as a joke but not really&lt;/a&gt; went on to be a critically recognized artist.

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing a condensed post this week because I have been so busy with work!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Joe and I finished our rewatch of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I still love the show. It goes downhill in season six and is borderline unwatchable in season seven, but I have such affection for all before that — especially the warm blanket, cozy autumn early seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m watching Joe play &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been listening to anything in particular — mostly shuffles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not have time for reading this week, but I&amp;rsquo;m so close to finishing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and I intend to start &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I loved &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.grubz.net/2024/10/why-even-come-out-if-youre-bi-or-pan&#34;&gt;grubz&amp;rsquo;s post about coming out&lt;/a&gt;. I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/coming-out/&#34;&gt;written on a similar subject here before&lt;/a&gt;, although their post has me also thinking about how the performance of gender roles in my relationship is, in many ways, queer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At a district-wide conference day, different teams delivered a training I helped develop. It&amp;rsquo;s something I have been pushing for since March of 2021. In many ways, it feels like a culmination of that journey — though I feel mixed about how our administration has behaved about it — but I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to view it as just another step forward. We have so much more to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started planning (and inviting people to) my birthday party! I am turning 30 next month and have all sorts of feelings about it. A friend who moved away a few months ago (and who we have dearly missed) is going to come out for it, too, so I am really just trying to focus on being excited to celebrate with the people I care about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing two weeks in one post. Last week I was dead sick and working too much so I didn&amp;rsquo;t assemble a post throughout the week as I normally do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Joe and I drove back to ___ for a funeral&amp;hellip; and then back, all in one day. Eight hours on the road, but it was nice to spend some time together, singing and talking about heavy things.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I ran four miles in one go! Not without stopping and walking, and I&amp;rsquo;m far from my best times, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to rebuild my endurance and speed after taking a long time off.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get back into skin care. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a thorough routine, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been slacking even on the meager bit I do. I looked in the mirror and saw an old person looking back at me, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been cleansing and moisturizing on a near-daily basis now.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating&lt;/em&gt; by Elizabeth Tova Bailey.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m reading this on recommendation of a friend and coworker. The writing has a beautiful directness, but I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly fascinated by (or at all interested in) snails. It is eye-opening to read something so scientific in approach that is still a work of literature, however; it leaves me to consider how our different disciplines — me as an English teacher and my coworker a Science teacher — change the way we think and look at the world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://platinumtulip.bearblog.dev/a-ranking-of-imac-g3-colors/&#34;&gt;a ranking of iMac G3 colors&lt;/a&gt; by tulip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thebirdhouse.bearblog.dev/field-notes-cured-my-twitter-addiction/&#34;&gt;field notes cured my twitter addiction&lt;/a&gt; on The Birdhouse.&lt;/strong&gt; A lovely ode to a notebook.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;, season six.&lt;/strong&gt; Joe and I have reached about the end of the season. I think six has some good moments and episodes but is, on the whole, drudgery. Luke&amp;rsquo;s character takes a bizarre turn, and I somehow have even less patience for Rory and Logan&amp;rsquo;s relationship this time around.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Model&lt;/em&gt;, cycle five.&lt;/strong&gt; Passive rewatches while folding laundry; the actual modeling and photoshoots are a low for the UPN seasons, but the personalities make it an entertaining season.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Joe and I have played more of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is really him watching me play and selecting dialogue options with me. He really does not care for the combat; I don&amp;rsquo;t love it either, but having played so much of this game and the first as a kid, I know my way around it much better. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to like any of the characters yet; on one hand, I get that, because I think the &lt;em&gt;KotOR II&lt;/em&gt; characters are much more complex and harder to initially like than the first game&amp;rsquo;s, but maybe the series just isn&amp;rsquo;t for him&amp;hellip;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing as a female Exile, but Joe was interested in the Handmaiden, and I prefer her to the Disciple, so I decided to roll back a save and use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://deadlystream.com/files/file/544-partyswap/&#34;&gt;PartySwap mod&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; until I realized that I have Steam Workshop mods mixed with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotor.neocities.org/modding/mod_builds/k2/full&#34;&gt;KotOR II Mod Build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Apparently, because I used the Workshop 13 years ago when I last played this game, Steam decided I definitely wanted those installed again. Ugh. The solution was to start from the beginning with cheats that will let me zip through and get back to where we were. It took the better part of five hours to re-install all the mods and play back through Peragus and Telos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That all said, I really love this game. I love the way the narrative places you in a backstory rather than the &amp;ldquo;blank slate&amp;rdquo; approach of the first game.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The player then gets to decide the Exile&amp;rsquo;s reasons for going to war, their outlook on the Jedi, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of gray area to be found.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Anyway’s Holey Spirits Perform! One Foot in Bethlehem&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pure Particles&lt;/em&gt; by The Bug Club.&lt;/strong&gt; More recommendations from a former student of mine. I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying them! &lt;em&gt;One Foot in Bethlehem&lt;/em&gt; very clearly has some religious satire, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not had a chance to parse for sub-text&amp;hellip; At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m on a basal, what&amp;rsquo;s catchy level (the answer is a lot).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;religion, marriage, the future&amp;hellip; the usual, at this point.

I&amp;rsquo;m awful and uncoordinated on the court, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to play with friends, and I have learned the hard way that I&amp;rsquo;m a lot less depressed when I&amp;rsquo;m active.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying reading ex-cohost folks on the bearblog discovery feed. The trending feed can get a little stale.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I hope they stick around.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I took a walk (and a run) with a dear friend that I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get together with for a while. She&amp;rsquo;s decades older than me, but we are incredibly like-minded. Kindred spirits. I appreciate her wisdom and guidance and friendship immensely as she listens to all my neuroses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Sunday night, Joe and I went to a wedding for two of our best friends. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll make a longer post with all that stirs up for me — thoughts on marriage and commitment&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, I left the wedding feeling sick. COVID test was negative so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping it&amp;rsquo;s just allergies from the changing season.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No One Belongs Here More than You,&lt;/em&gt; Miranda July.&lt;/strong&gt; I stand by what I said last week. I think I need a break from the sexual deviants I&amp;rsquo;m apparently (and unconsciously) selecting lately. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to be done with this; I appreciated July&amp;rsquo;s occasional wit and found it Handler-esque, but those touches were few and far between, and the rest of it mostly just grossed me out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My next books will be &lt;em&gt;The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating&lt;/em&gt;, recommended by a friend and coworker, and, I think, &lt;em&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve always meant to read. It might not seem like much for an English teacher, but these past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading for pleasure more than I have in years and it has me feeling so full. It&amp;rsquo;s great to rediscover that joy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://netigen.com/read/linkin-park-from-zero&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Linkin Park, From Zero&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by n3verm0re.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not a Linkin Park fan by any means, but I have been interested in seeing how a group reawakens after such a tremendous loss. I really enjoyed this piece about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Dream in F#&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rare Birds&lt;/em&gt;, The Bug Club.&lt;/strong&gt; I asked a student of mine what kind of music she listened to; she said her music was too weird and I&amp;rsquo;d probably never heard of it. I took that as a personal challenge. But it&amp;rsquo;s not that weird — although, as an (ex?) Xiu Xiu listener, my barometer is off. I liked both albums! They&amp;rsquo;re light, fun listening, and absolutely up my alley.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romance is Boring&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos!&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to the music students of mine like has me thinking about the music I was in love with at their age. &lt;em&gt;RiB&lt;/em&gt; came out at the exact right time for me and holds a special place in my heart. I listen to tracks from it often, but this was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d revisited some deeper cuts, like &amp;ldquo;Who Fell Asleep In,&amp;rdquo; in years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos!&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m still forming my larger thoughts on &lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt;, but it was interesting to compare side-by-side with &lt;em&gt;RiB&lt;/em&gt;. It is far more even and consistent in quality — &lt;em&gt;RiB&lt;/em&gt; has some all-timers but also some real duds (&amp;ldquo;Plan A&amp;rdquo;) — but there is a visceral, adolescent melodrama to &lt;em&gt;RiB&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt; lacks. &lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt; is instead grown up and wistfully forlorn, especially compared to juggernauts like &amp;ldquo;I Just Sighed.&amp;rdquo; Both are good and appropriate for me at different times and headspaces, but &lt;em&gt;RiB&lt;/em&gt; holds more of hook — although I have fifteen years of relationship and baggage with it compared to &lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about a recurring theme in songs I am or have been fixated on —&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Drops (reprise),&amp;rdquo; The Peripheral Ones&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;I know if I don&amp;rsquo;t go now I won&amp;rsquo;t make it out&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Whale Song,&amp;rdquo; Modest Mouse&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;I guess I am a scout / so I should find a way out / so everyone can find a way out&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ave Maria,&amp;rdquo; Mac Miller&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Have you found a way out?&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come Back to Earth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;I just need a way out of my head / I&amp;rsquo;ll do anything for a way out of my head&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;— the idea of making it out is, of course, not a unique theme, but perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;em&gt;The House on Mango Street&lt;/em&gt; resonated with me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the ones I left behind. For the ones who cannot out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think posts don&amp;rsquo;t decay quickly enough from the feed, and the top page or two of trending posts are all by the same handful of people. There&amp;rsquo;s a handful of very active posters, which is a great thing, but I like to see variety there.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, a music teacher, told me a few months ago, sadly, that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t finding joy in listening to music recreationally anymore. She made a life change and was hoping to reclaim it. I think that&amp;rsquo;s what inspired me to start reading again. I of course engage with literature in my job as an English teacher, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always mentally stimulating — for the most parts, I&amp;rsquo;m reading the same texts over and over to a young audience.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I&amp;rsquo;m almost entirely off Twitter; I keep the app just because I have a few notifications set for when specific people tweet (mostly bands who tweet out tour dates), but I&amp;rsquo;m otherwise mostly on Mastodon (social.lol) and Discord. Cohost going down was sad to see even if I was never an active user and there were problems with it, but its downfall impressed on me even further the importance of owning your content — and it made me really happy to have this space for my thoughts and writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I got my COVID booster and flu shot on Friday, which put me out of order for some time. Glad to have them done, however; one day of discomfort is worth it!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The weight of being a teacher really set on me this week — not the teaching work, which I love, but the emotional weight of my students&amp;rsquo; lives. It&amp;rsquo;s especially hard to see kids that remind me of myself at their age and wish I could impart all that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned — but knowing that there are no shortcuts and that the only way out for them is through. I can&amp;rsquo;t pluck them out; they have to live it. I can only hope to be there for them as they do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No One Belongs Here More than You&lt;/em&gt;, Miranda July.&lt;/strong&gt; This has been in my Amazon wishlist for I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long — long enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten where I&amp;rsquo;d found it or why I&amp;rsquo;d wanted to read it. I liked the cover a lot, I guess. Anyway, I feel this is suffering from my reading it so soon after &lt;em&gt;Death Is Not an Option&lt;/em&gt; as I have much of the same opinion: excellent prose but turned off by all the weird sex.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I find July&amp;rsquo;s narrators and conceits to be far more varied than Rivecca&amp;rsquo;s, but Rivecca never made me read about an old man who fantasizes about teenage girls, so I automatically like her better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/meet-lochlan-oneil-the-creator-of&#34;&gt;Meet Lochlan O&amp;rsquo;Neil, the creator of DashCon&lt;/a&gt; on Garbage Day.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I had to go to extensive therapy because I was like, “oh my god, I, Lochlan O&amp;rsquo;Neil, single-handedly destroyed fandom culture?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon 4Ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Joe and I got our shit rocked by the COVID and flu shots and decided to watch this. Middling, but a surprising environmentalist message. I&amp;rsquo;m realizing how much of who Joe is goes back to Pokémon, of all things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;, season five.&lt;/strong&gt; Joe and I went back in for a few episodes in our shot stupor. Still enjoyable, but we are quickly gaining on the last of the good episodes in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;i,i&lt;/em&gt;, Bon Iver.&lt;/strong&gt; Not bad, but I like &lt;em&gt;For Emma&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;22, A Million&lt;/em&gt; far more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt;, The Peripheral Ones.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve said before that this album is perhaps the most esoteric of my bullshit; it&amp;rsquo;s a cover album of a little-known&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Myspace-era band, &lt;a href=&#34;https://themiddleones.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;The Middle Ones&lt;/a&gt;, done by &lt;a href=&#34;https://pigthe.bandcamp.com/music&#34;&gt;pigthe&lt;/a&gt; (the guitarist for &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/music&#34;&gt;Trust Fund&lt;/a&gt;). The album is obscure enough that it&amp;rsquo;s not on MusicBrainz (I&amp;rsquo;m aware that I could add it) and the band has 23 listeners on last.fm.

I love the first seven cycles best, but cycle three has a special place in my heart. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the first cycles I ever saw and has one of the most entertaining casts. The modelling itself is pretty poor, but that&amp;rsquo;s not really what &lt;em&gt;Top Model&lt;/em&gt; was about.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ei6dNr3RkY&amp;amp;list=PLipgnTt01UGXDW2B_eJMKSSi12Y7koJ9O&amp;amp;pp=iAQB&#34;&gt;Run Button&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Outlaws&lt;/em&gt; streams.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in &lt;em&gt;Outlaws&lt;/em&gt; based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen; Keith has been complaining about the stealth a lot in the streams, but I think a good amount of that has been player error.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to get Joe to play &lt;em&gt;KotOR&lt;/em&gt; for years, but he was turned off by the combat. We listened to A More Civilized Age&amp;rsquo;s coverage together, though (he&amp;rsquo;s a big Friends at the Table fan), and it got him interested in &lt;em&gt;KotOR II&lt;/em&gt; (despite my insisting for years that it is the finest piece of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; media). We&amp;rsquo;re playing through together — me with the controller but collectively making decisions. We&amp;rsquo;re still on Peragus (gross), but I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying revisiting it. This will be my first time playing it in at least ten years and my first time with the restored content mod.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life&amp;rsquo;s a Riot With Spy vs Spy&lt;/em&gt;, Billy Bragg.&lt;/strong&gt; I like &amp;ldquo;A New England&amp;rdquo; a whole lot; the rest was good but didn&amp;rsquo;t grab me. There&amp;rsquo;s a sparseness and intimacy that struck me when I first heard &amp;ldquo;A New England,&amp;rdquo; but the novelty had worn off for the other tracks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Emma, Forever Ago&lt;/em&gt;, Bon Iver.&lt;/strong&gt; I listened to this all the way through one night and it unfortunately really spoke to me. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve listened through it before, years ago, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t care for anything except &amp;ldquo;Skinny Love&amp;rdquo;; this time around, every track hit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bishop, CA&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wig Master,&amp;rdquo; Xiu Xiu.&lt;/strong&gt; I swore off Xiu Xiu back in 2013 or so after listening to them heavily during a deep depression; I&amp;rsquo;m not cold turkey on them anymore, but they&amp;rsquo;re not in my regular rotation either. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of these two, some of my favorites then.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in so far as any Xiu Xiu song is a &amp;ldquo;favorite&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;a desperate cry for help&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I will miss being on the bearblog discovery feed, but this is also a push for me to get involved more on webrings &amp;amp; other small web communities.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong&gt;starting to get my classroom ready&lt;/strong&gt; for the school year. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about some of the changes I&amp;rsquo;m making — the physical layout of the room, curricular changes, routines, and philosophies. We go back to school on Tuesday, so this is really the end stretch of summer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I was pretty social this week! I had a friend and coworker over to help us identify some of the plants we have on our property; had a different friend over to play some games; went to see a Fleetwood Mac cover band with some of my partner&amp;rsquo;s coworkers; and had my sister and her boyfriend over to go hiking and out to lunch.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gkeenan.co/avgb/an-unrelenting-sense-of-longing/&#34;&gt;An unrelenting sense of longing (or: “Maps”)&lt;/a&gt; by Keenan.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Maps&amp;rdquo; rocks and I love reading fellow music sickos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Is Not an Option&lt;/em&gt; by Suzanne Rivecca.&lt;/strong&gt; Plugging along, slowly.

Their music lacks some novelty compared to the live performance, but I still like a few songs — notably, &amp;ldquo;Anymore,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Nothingness Lies Coiled at the Heart of Being (It’s Such a Good Feeling),&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Forever Endeavor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYRRR3vRroA&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Feather Test&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by A Weather.&lt;/strong&gt; This may be my song this year.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I fell in love with it a few months ago and returned to it this week. I love, I love, I love (&lt;em&gt;I will, I will&lt;/em&gt;). A beautiful, breathy mix of fleeting, intersecting harmonies with a rich and simplistic production. Every line strikes. (&amp;ldquo;Brush your hand / Across where you felt me / Do I pass the feather test?&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, importantly, I blog to write, not to be read. I guess.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song came out 17 years ago. I don&amp;rsquo;t care. It means something to me now.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Automattic&#39;s Write Brief is, unsurprisingly, full of shit</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Automattic &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/07/automattic-launches-ai-writing-tool-that-aims-to-make-wordpress-blogs-more-readable-and-succinct/&#34;&gt;recently launched their Write Brief AI assistant&lt;/a&gt; for folks using Jetpack with WordPress.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is automatically available to anyone using wordpress.com, which I verified by logging into my 14-year-old account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to test it out on my recent post about &lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt;. I chose this because it&amp;rsquo;s one of my more recent posts that isn&amp;rsquo;t #week-notes . I pasted it directly into the Gutenberg editor with all of the AI settings toggled on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Write Brief, my &amp;ldquo;Reading grade score&amp;rdquo; is 11.05; they recommend between 8 and 12 for maximum readable. Most of the AI&amp;rsquo;s complaints with me were the long sentences within the post (it identified 20). Some of them, I agree with, even if they are all grammatically correct.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Take, for example, the following sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flannery has to kill Adam because I’d be just as dissatisfied if she didn’t, and I’d be here complaining that Handler didn’t have the guts to follow through on his promising hook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not an overly complicated sentence; it is a compound-complex sentence, grammatically, with five distinct clauses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flannery has to kill Adam&amp;rdquo; (independent)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;because I’d be just as dissatisfied&amp;rdquo; (dependent)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;if she didn’t&amp;rdquo; (dependent)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I’d be here complaining&amp;rdquo; (independent; joined with the coordinating conjunction &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;that Handler didn’t have the guts to follow through on his promising hook&amp;rdquo; (relative clause)&#xA;That &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like a lot, and maybe it is, but the sentence reads fairly easily — we are constantly stacking clauses on top of each other in the English language.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Write Brief&amp;rsquo;s proposed revision is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flannery has to kill Adam. I’d be just as dissatisfied if she didn’t. I’d be here complaining that Handler didn’t have the guts to follow through on his promising hook. I’ll keep telling myself that until I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It essentially separated the clauses out to be mostly simple sentences, with the exception of the last sentence — which would be impossible to split apart without inserting a number of words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most puzzlingly, Write Brief took umbrage with my use of the word &amp;ldquo;cannot&amp;rdquo; because it is a &amp;ldquo;complex word&amp;rdquo; and suggested I revise it to &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; forcing an informal voice without ever asking me if that&amp;rsquo;s what I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, whatever; I&amp;rsquo;m just an idiot with a blog. My writing is not exactly a gold standard of readability and clarity.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Let&amp;rsquo;s instead test the model on some of the literary greats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course I must start with Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;, one of the finest works in the canon. I tried the iconic first sentence, &amp;ldquo;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.&amp;rdquo; Write Brief concluded that this, too, was a &amp;ldquo;long sentence&amp;rdquo; and suggested the following revision:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a truth universally acknowledged. A single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the AI is simply splitting the clauses up, but in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s butchering the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; (let alone the style and humor!) of the sentence! &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; is a truth universally acknowledged?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s fast-forward in time a little to simpler prose.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m trying to avoid anything with dialogue, so let&amp;rsquo;s try the final major section of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Write Brief took no issue with the final two paragraphs — presumably because they&amp;rsquo;re composed only of simple and compound sentences. The entire first paragraph was flagged, once again for the &amp;ldquo;long sentences&amp;rdquo; and because &amp;ldquo;could&amp;rdquo; is an &amp;ldquo;unconfident word.&amp;rdquo; Write Brief&amp;rsquo;s recommended edit was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world. I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn. His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him. It was somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city. The dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This revision preserves the intent of the passage but again enforces the staccato rhythm of mostly simple sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the final test must be on Hemingway, who espoused cutting his writing to the bone (n.b. I also think he was full of shit). To give Write Brief the best possible shake, I&amp;rsquo;m deliberately selecting a fairly simplistic paragraph from early in the first chapter of &lt;em&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it&#xA;carefully. The old man looked over his shoulder. He was a short and solid old man in a&#xA;black peasant’s smock and gray iron-stiff trousers and he wore rope-soled shoes. He&#xA;was breathing heavily from the climb and his hand rested on one of the two heavy packs&#xA;they had been carrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet again, Write Brief believes this paragraph to contain long sentences, and it suggested this revision:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it&lt;br&gt;&#xA;carefully. The old man looked over his shoulder. He was a short and solid old man. He wore a black peasant’s smock and gray iron-stiff trousers. He also wore rope-soled shoes. He  was breathing heavily from the climb. His hand rested on one of the two heavy packs  they had been carrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This revision &lt;em&gt;inserted&lt;/em&gt; several words to enforce its stylistic choices for sentence structure. Note the redundancy in &amp;ldquo;He wore a black&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;He also wore rope-soled&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; If one of my students handed this in to me, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest they do some sentence-combining. My students are 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing can and should be revised to be concise and readable — even the writing we do online. That&amp;rsquo;s not what I take issue with. Forgetting that blogs are often, by practice, stream of consciousness, and WordPress is ostensibly a blogging platform, it is our unique writing styles — the structures we use and gravitate toward and the decisions we make to conform to or break those structures — that make us individuals. There is joy and beauty in seeing people as they are, and that includes online. We sometimes must compromise our idiosyncrasies to be successfully communicate — after all, communication only happens when a message is sent &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; understood — and the individual blogger can, of course, simply turn off or ignore these suggestions and make stylistic choices for themselves. And really, this AI is nothing more than a tool to turn complex and compound-complex sentences into simple or compound ones — without any other considerations like modifiers or participles and at the cost of original voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is joy and value in expressing ourselves &lt;em&gt;how we are&lt;/em&gt;, not how some bullshit external rules tell us &lt;em&gt;how to be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — because there is always one culture or mode of expression that is valued by the people making the AI, and those who exist outside of that hegemony are treated as wrong and in need of revision. I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to sound like an elementary schooler who never learned to use a comma and therefore simply avoids them. I want to experience the beautiful, unique minds of the bloggers I follow. I want authenticity, not the yassified, sanitized version of you. I will continue to cling to my strung-out sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have actual data on this, but I&amp;rsquo;d assume this is the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of WordPress users.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have two halves of an English degree so I can be trusted to make these assertions.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I write for myself and to capture what&amp;rsquo;s in my head, which is mostly nonsense.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I eat too much salt to confidently put in anything by Shakespeare and expect to survive the experience.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize the same argument could be applied to all grammar rules — I side with linguistic descriptivism, and on the web, I generally encourage people to write how they want. Omit punctuation! Don&amp;rsquo;t capitalize! If it bothers me, I have the choice not to read. (Formal academic writing is different.)&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to cassie.ink, the new home of my blog and web stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previously, this blog was hosted at bearblog under the domain cassie.land. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m using the SSG Hugo to create the site, which deploys to Github Pages for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why the move?&lt;/strong&gt; I love bearblog and recommend it to just about anyone who wants to get into blogging and the small web — it&amp;rsquo;s dead simple for folks with no web expertise, it has an awesome community, and the discover page allows you to share your content and connect with folks also using the platform. Unfortunately, I am, at heart, a tinkerer — bearblog felt a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy, and a little limiting for some of the visions I have. And, ultimately, I just want to &lt;strong&gt;own my content&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;embrace new technologies and challenges&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m committed to pushing myself to blog because I love writing and want to do it more. I keep a physical journal for my more private thoughts and neuroses (affectionately nicknamed my &amp;ldquo;little fucking diary&amp;rdquo;), but I also think there&amp;rsquo;s value in creating a public log of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, what I&amp;rsquo;m into, what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking. I have a complicated relationship with the internet and probably spend way too much time on it, but I love to be online and connect with other like-minded people. Blogging — and blogging in a space that I own and control and can set boundaries with — feels like the healthiest way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I changed the domain because I think it&amp;rsquo;s funny. I still love cassie.land and may come up with some other use for it.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But I refer to my hobbies and interests often (and jokingly) as my &lt;strong&gt;esoteric bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;, and this website is a tribute to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-it-works&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        how it works&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic setup is not too complicated. I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to generate the site from a series of Markdown files (my posts and pages) along with a custom theme I made myself. That&amp;rsquo;s all stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bansheebeat/esotericbullshit&#34;&gt;a public Github repository&lt;/a&gt;, and when changes are pushed to the repo, it rebuilds the site on Github Pages and makes it accessible to the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previously, on bearblog, I was writing my posts in an Obsidian vault that was stored on my NAS at home. I used Syncthing to be able to access it from my phone wherever I was; when a post was finished, I would just copy and paste it into the bearblog editor and publish. This mostly worked for me, and I liked being able to write from any device. So one of the stipulations I set for myself in moving to Hugo was that I needed to be able to write and publish posts from mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Posting from my PC isn&amp;rsquo;t hard; I still write in Obsidian, and I just push the changes to Github from my PC. Mobile presented more of a challenge. I spent a lot of time going in circles and reading various guides on how to do it — I explored &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git&#34;&gt;obsidian-git&lt;/a&gt; but ruled it out due to issues pulling large numbers of files; I thought about just using Github&amp;rsquo;s website in my browser and adding files that way; I considered diving into &lt;a href=&#34;https://termux.dev/en/&#34;&gt;Termux&lt;/a&gt; to clone and push from my phone. All of that just seemed so fiddly or complicated or just had too many drawbacks; most of all, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create any barriers to writing. I just wanted to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and have the words show up online. No extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I stumbled on Ben Butterworth&amp;rsquo;s post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://orth.uk/obsidian-sync/&#34;&gt;Syncing Obsidian Vault on macOS and Android, for free, using git&lt;/a&gt;. He recommended the Android app &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitjournal.io/&#34;&gt;Gitjournal&lt;/a&gt;, and then everything clicked into place: Gitjournal gives me an easy editor for writing/editing my content on my phone and handles the commits and pushes to the repository for me. I&amp;rsquo;d really like to use Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s Android app, but right now, there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal/issues/925&#34;&gt;noted issue&lt;/a&gt; with Gitjournal that prevents the repo from being stored on the file system (which I would then just point my Android Obsidian vault to). I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful it will be resolved soon and I can use my preferred app, but Gitjournal works just fine for now. Best of all, this setup is &lt;strong&gt;practically idiot-proof&lt;/strong&gt; (hi, it&amp;rsquo;s me)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and presents few to no barriers to what&amp;rsquo;s important: &lt;strong&gt;the writing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;afoot-and-lighthearted&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#afoot-and-lighthearted&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        afoot and lighthearted&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what now? I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep blogging and trying new things; this is just the new home for it all. And because it&amp;rsquo;s all owned, managed, and generated by me, I can do whatever the fuck I want with it. Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s just a standard blog, but I plan to get weird with it. Thanks for reading and joining along with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on redirecting all links from cassie.land to here.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to setting this site up, I had never really used git or Github besides downloading shit other people made. One of my goals was to push myself to learn how to. I consider myself tech-minded, but really, I think this was very easy — and I basically don&amp;rsquo;t have to interact with git or Github now besides pushing a button. It&amp;rsquo;s all automated.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

All I really want to do is be alone in my house, left to do my silly little projects.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying still to move away from big, corporate social media — I have been spending more time on Mastodon and the bearblog discover feed. I&amp;rsquo;ve scarcely opened Twitter, and I&amp;rsquo;ve set 30m app timers for Facebook and Instagram. I rarely hit it for either, but something about knowing the timer is there makes me more conscious of the time I&amp;rsquo;m wasting on them. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy yet with my screen time as a whole, but at least I feel I&amp;rsquo;m seeing more of real people (and people I choose to follow) than algorithms and dark patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Friday, I went to IKEA with a friend and my sister to get some things for the house and a few items for my classroom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I intended to go into school on Saturday and begin some of the physical setup I need to do, but I felt sick and exhausted. I took a COVID test (negative) — I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it&amp;rsquo;s just holdover from a long day of driving on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a-demain.bearblog.dev/studying-to-be-a-teacher-in-the-modern-day/&#34;&gt;Studying to be a teacher in the modern day&lt;/a&gt; by Sparrow.&lt;/strong&gt; I feel the same about teaching as Sparrow: it&amp;rsquo;s a hard career to choose in today&amp;rsquo;s education system and economic climate, but teaching is so intrinsically part of me that I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing anything else. Even with the stress, the low pay, the poor working conditions, I love it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://marblethoughts.bearblog.dev/what-a-demure-mindful-and-brat-summer/&#34;&gt;What a demure, mindful, and brat summer&lt;/a&gt; by Kayla.&lt;/strong&gt; Great introspective piece on trends and shifting mindsets. As I get older, I&amp;rsquo;m less connected to fads (especially because I&amp;rsquo;m not on TikTok and have curated my social media feeds), but I do try hard to understand them — I never want to be someone who brushes things off as &amp;ldquo;kids these days&amp;rdquo; absurdity and who blames the younger generation for every societal woe. Brat summer and demure sound silly, but there&amp;rsquo;s importance in trying to understand what matters to young people&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — and we can only reach state of cooperation and harmony through mutual understanding and respect.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slate.com/advice/2024/08/dear-prudence-coworkers-too-personal.html&#34;&gt;Help! I Invited My Coworkers Into a Very Personal Part of My Life. Now I Really Regret It.&lt;/a&gt; by Hillary Frey.&lt;/strong&gt; I read Dear, Prudence often to satisfy my busybody tendencies and, occasionally, to talk through social quandaries with my partner. The first letter here hit particularly hard; I am a teacher and regularly have coworkers ask super invasive questions about my family planning. I&amp;rsquo;m friends with someone who went through IVF and she&amp;rsquo;s opened my eyes to how these &amp;ldquo;innocent questions&amp;rdquo; (they&amp;rsquo;re not) can hurt folks dealing with infertility. I&amp;rsquo;m not, but even I find questions about whether I&amp;rsquo;m trying for a baby super invasive!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.avas.space/kindness-online/&#34;&gt;finding kindness online&lt;/a&gt; by ava.&lt;/strong&gt; A great piece about connection in gaming. I have baggage with video game-centric spaces online, but this gives me some hope.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Too Model,&lt;/em&gt; cycle 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Mostly passive viewing while folding laundry, but cycle 1 has a special quality. It feels less like a reality show and more like a documentary about what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be on a reality show. The budget is clearly low and the show hadn&amp;rsquo;t established its structure just yet, so the contestants learn how the show works along with us. It feels grounded and authentic — for a season of &lt;em&gt;Top Model&lt;/em&gt;, that is.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bYvqnTvUCg&amp;amp;list=PLe_AuQUfBKl5R3Sc7Erpq3Y2me6q6uZ0R&#34;&gt;Into the Aether&amp;rsquo;s Pokemon Emerald Nuzlocke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Joe and I are continuing this and still really loving it!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m slowly working through the post-&lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt; patch content. Joe is still playing through &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m levelling Warrior to do dungeons alongside him as a new class. I&amp;rsquo;m enduring the slow, painful grind of levelling my Squadrons, too. I like the concept of Squadrons — they remind me of my beloved &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but unfortunately there is very little variety and a lot of waiting involved here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon White Version&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I was inspired to jump into a Pokémon game by the Nuzlocke Joe and I are watching. I&amp;rsquo;ve never really played &lt;em&gt;White&lt;/em&gt;; maybe a year ago I did the first three gyms, but I remember none of it. I started it over on Saturday night.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing really specific — just some shuffles.

I have no interest in playing a PS1 or PSP game at the moment (or ever? — no hate to either console or their libraries, but I like modern conveniences and quality of life upgrades), so I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for the remake that is almost certainly in the works.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I noticed it months ago with Mac Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;GO:ODAM&lt;/em&gt;, but I thought it might just be the press. We fixed it and now I feel I have to re-listen to all my records.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;Spoilers to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote in my week notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Handler.&lt;/strong&gt; Handler&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Adverbs&lt;/em&gt; is often what I cite when folks ask what my favorite book is, and I loved &lt;em&gt;Watch Your Mouth&lt;/em&gt;, too. I need light reprieves from &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, too, so this seemed an excellent time to round out my reading of Handler&amp;rsquo;s bibliography. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through and enraptured by the narrative voice. It&amp;rsquo;s pretentious, as a story narrated by a precocious high school senior should be, without being cloying, and with Handler&amp;rsquo;s charming humor throughout. I love it so far and have faith that the feeling will continue. I normally hate books set in high school, but this one takes me back to my high school self — somehow, in a good way, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finished the book an hour or two after posting that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stand by some of that: I love Handler&amp;rsquo;s prose, his humor, his ability to string you along in suspense when you know the ending, and paramount here, his playfulness with plot structures and meta-narrative. In reading others&amp;rsquo; reviews online&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I am finding that detractors felt the main characters to be irritatingly privileged, unrealistic, and arty (to which I say &lt;em&gt;of course they are&lt;/em&gt; — they are high school characters in a fictional book and &lt;em&gt;they are meant to be&lt;/em&gt; — but I can see how that might make almost 400 page a slog to read for some&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and that the twist was easy to guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps here is where I must turn in my English degree as I admit sheepishly that I did not see the twist coming at all, despite acknowledging Flannery as an unreliable narrator (clearly not realizing to what extent) and &lt;em&gt;knowing in advance that there was a twist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I will reiterate my spoiler warning and no longer dance around it. Natasha, Flannery&amp;rsquo;s best friend and a purported member of the Basic Eight friend group, does not exist — is a manifestation of Flannery&amp;rsquo;s id, the voice and actor in what she wishes to say or do but lacks the courage to own. The twist is outplayed by the almost thirty years of media that stand between me and &lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s publication (interestingly, the book was published in the same year &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt; the movie was released, so perhaps it was more novel (get it?) a twist then), and it&amp;rsquo;s a shlockiness that I don&amp;rsquo;t expect from Handler (his adult novels, at least). In &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; defense, it was his first novel, and the shlock is intentional I think. And in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; further defense (to whom? to whom?), while the twist is subtly revealed (thank you to the reviewer who mentioned page 99, which hits you right in the face), Handler also deliberately covers it up &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the unreliable narration. There&amp;rsquo;s layers-upon-layers of clever unreliability at work, but the twist nonetheless left me dissatisfied by the ending. I closed the book and was left asking, &amp;ldquo;Is that all there is?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having known that there was a twist ahead of me, I had hoped it was around Adam&amp;rsquo;s murder. Flannery reveals early in the narrative that she kills Adam, a boy she is in love with — the entire narration of the book hinges upon this, and the murder is the climax of the book. As I reached that moment, I read almost through my fingers and hoped that the twist was that she didn&amp;rsquo;t actually kill him; instead, that the twist was that she built this (again, intentionally) ridiculous narrative frame around an invented murder to cope with the simple fact of teenage heartbreak and shitty high school boys; creating the artifice of teen murder media frenzy as an allegory for the high school gossip scene; positioning herself as a ward of the state to punish herself for letting her teen angst bullshit tear apart the Basic Eight, her beloved band of misfits, disappointing and dissolving her friendship with Natasha, and losing herself in the process. The narrative frame would then fulfill Hattie&amp;rsquo;s prophecy that Flannery would become wise — in a typically kooky Handler way, by constructing fictional talk shows and discussion questions — but with the empty lesson we adults learn: wisdom comes through experience, and that experience usually blows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a writer and it is for a good reason. Reader, she does kill Adam. My proposed revision is probably a corny ending too, and perhaps I need to eat the words I say to Joe as he makes us quit watching shows like &lt;em&gt;Search Party&lt;/em&gt; because he can&amp;rsquo;t stand to watch characters make bad decisions over and over again: that&amp;rsquo;s conflict! That&amp;rsquo;s what makes for interesting stories! Flannery has to kill Adam because I&amp;rsquo;d be just as dissatisfied if she &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;d be here complaining that Handler didn&amp;rsquo;t have the guts to follow through on his promising hook. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep telling myself that until I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m left annoyed. Natasha being Flannery&amp;rsquo;s invented shadow-self seems clichéd by 2024 standards. It undercuts the beautiful, ride or die female friendship that I loved, especially during the uncomfortable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; episode with Mr. Carr. In fact, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; Flannery and Natasha&amp;rsquo;s friendship, the girls of the Basic Eight friend group — Flannery included — are awfully catty to each other, in a way that makes me uncomfortable considering this book was written by an adult man.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Flannery&amp;rsquo;s only supportive friends become the male ones — Douglas and Gabriel — and Kate and Flannery a derisive mockery of teenage girls who gossip and steal each other&amp;rsquo;s flames. Kate&amp;rsquo;s orchestration of the murder cover-up becomes a self-interested satisfaction that the ex who wronged her is dead; V___ is merely protecting her social standing; Lily is emotional and throws up in stress; Jenn I cannot remember at 1:28am; and Flannery, crucially, hates and excludes Flora. When there&amp;rsquo;s no light in the dark — no Natasha for Flannery — the representation of teenage female friendships and, by extension, teenage female &lt;em&gt;characters&lt;/em&gt; becomes sneering instead of complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most egregiously, &lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s twist feels like the bogey monster of &lt;em&gt;but the main character was crazy all along!&lt;/em&gt;, which scrapes dangerously close to my other hated contrivance, &lt;em&gt;it was all a dream&lt;/em&gt;, and it undercuts Handler&amp;rsquo;s actual main goal: to satirize the media frenzy of violent teens and Satanic panic. You can&amp;rsquo;t do that while also using the same devices of those who create Satanic panic. It&amp;rsquo;s instead a satire Ouroboros, feeding the thing it hopes to destroy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt; is a good book. It is well-written and I enjoyed reading it mostly. The ending disappointed me. Those can all be compatible statements, simple truths, and I can live with that complication. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep saying that too until I believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adverbs&lt;/em&gt;, I love you regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am choosing in this moment to treat online reviews as a literary salon instead of the crippling self-doubt of not being able to figure out what I think without seeing how others feel. Am I a people pleaser? A phony? As Flannery would write, more on that later.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a formerly pretentious high schooler with a livejournal archive as documentary evidence, so not only am I deeply accustomed to this portrait, and any irritation is tinged with that darkened self-awareness that I am, in many ways, looking into a mirror. Is my dissatisfaction with the twist and Flannery&amp;rsquo;s eventual murder of Adam because I see too much of my teen self in Flannery? Discuss.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was my fun summer poolside read, where I can just turn off my brain and read for entertainment !&lt;/em&gt;, I say desperately, clinging to my waning credibility and intellect.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be uncomfortable, because it&amp;rsquo;s a high school teacher raping one of his students, but here I use uncomfortable to mean &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m okay with this being a plot device in the book, especially under the light of Natasha not being real.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started on the body image shit.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I&amp;rsquo;m conflicted, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;m sticking on bearblog.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I also bought a domain without a plan to use it — I love cassieland, but this one speaks to me, and it has an air of anonymity, which is appealing should I pursue my goal to blog more; anonymity feels safer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Joe and I went to visit family, so we&amp;rsquo;re spending a weekend lake- and pool-side, and I&amp;rsquo;m reminded for the ten thousandth time of how wonderful he is with children. The biological clock ticks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wavelengths.online/posts/how-did-this-new-harry-potter-ride-get-approved&#34;&gt;How Did This New Harry Potter Ride Get Approved?&lt;/a&gt; by Brendon Bigley.&lt;/strong&gt; I used to be a tremendous &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; fan but consciously decoupled from the series given J.K. Rowling&amp;rsquo;s modern social campaign of hate. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to and enjoyed Universal&amp;rsquo;s Wizarding World, but I agree with Brendon&amp;rsquo;s stance: it is bizarre when Universal leans into the thinly veiled Nazism parallels for their theme park and ask attendees to rejoice in war crime trials.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Handler.&lt;/strong&gt; Handler&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Adverbs&lt;/em&gt; is often what I cite when folks ask what my favorite book is, and I loved &lt;em&gt;Watch Your Mouth&lt;/em&gt;, too. I need light reprieves from &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, too, so this seemed an excellent time to round out my reading of Handler&amp;rsquo;s bibliography. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through and enraptured by the narrative voice. It&amp;rsquo;s pretentious, as a story narrated by a precocious high school senior should be, without being cloying, and with Handler&amp;rsquo;s charming humor throughout. I love it so far and have faith that the feeling will continue. I normally hate books set in high school, but this one takes me back to my high school self — somehow, in a good way, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;, season five.&lt;/strong&gt; Continuing on; we are reaching the point where Joe stopped watching years ago — I had him watch the show with me when we first started dating — so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get into fresh content. Unfortunately, the show goes downhill, in my opinion, by season six, so we are in the last of the good.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Model&lt;/em&gt;, cycle six.&lt;/strong&gt; If I believed in guilty pleasures, &lt;em&gt;ANTM&lt;/em&gt; would be mine. Fortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t, so I can indulge all I&amp;rsquo;d like in junk food TV. I think the first seven seasons are all gold, but I was in the mood for Jade&amp;rsquo;s antics in six — truly one of the most unhinged individuals to ever appear on the show.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; An incredible follow-up to a film I loved very much; I agree that the cliffhanger ending undercuts some of the story&amp;rsquo;s structure, but if you frame it as Gwen&amp;rsquo;s story — which I think it was in many ways — it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more satisfying, like a sophomore sojourn into another major character. On a technical and artistic level, it&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable achievement; the painterly visuals and use of color in Gwen&amp;rsquo;s universe were particular standouts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos!&lt;/strong&gt; My record finally came in. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take time for me to form an opinion and weight it against their discography — I&amp;rsquo;ve got to let it sink — but as of right now, I really like it. &amp;ldquo;Clown Blood&amp;rdquo; is an early favorite.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our friends brought their kayaks and Joe rented one. We would like to invest in our own, but most of our money this summer has gone to home repairs.

        &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Write a blog post about words of wisdom your younger self would have appreciated hearing.&#xA;(via &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogprompts.fyi&#34;&gt;blogprompts&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying out doing blog prompts in an effort to populate this blog with more than just weekly round-ups and to get more comfortable writing about personal things.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to select two quotes — both song lyrics — that have resonated for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is from &amp;ldquo;Banshee Beat&amp;rdquo; by Animal Collective, which I first heard in my late teens (maybe 16?) and still consider one of my favorite songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way you look at it,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have your fits&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have my fits&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But feeling is good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My childhood was rife with trauma surrounding my parents&amp;rsquo; divorce and the ensuing fallout. All through it, I refused to talk to anyone about any of it — and I needed to. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I was 20 years old, with my current partner, that I ever vocalized how it all made me feel. I have healed (some, or at least scarred over) since, but I still feel the aftershocks. In times of stress or great emotion, I clam up and shut down. I return to stasis because I perceive it as safety — and avoid letting emotion in. I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to work on it and push through, but hearing &amp;ldquo;Banshee Beat&amp;rdquo; was an inflection point. The song opens as a quiet whisper and crescendos into jubilant emotion. I&amp;rsquo;m still working toward that joyful ending, but &amp;ldquo;Banshee Beat&amp;rdquo; was the first step out of the dark. It shook me awake and forced me to accept that my stoicism was a defense — that I had to allow myself to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; emotions instead of avoiding them. In order to experience the good, I had to let in the bad, to process it, let it wash over me, and come out unburdened. I&amp;rsquo;d have my fits, but feeling is good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next lyric comes from &amp;ldquo;2009&amp;rdquo; by Mac Miller, off his album &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to jump in to swim&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The light was dim in this life of sin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now every day I wake up and breathe&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have it all but that&amp;rsquo;s alright with me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of beauty to be found in the lyrics to &amp;ldquo;2009&amp;rdquo; (and &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; as a whole), but I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus here for now — and specifically on the opening line. The meaning here is clear, and not far off from the message in &amp;ldquo;Banshee Beat&amp;rdquo;: we have to open ourselves up to the unknown to live fully, and often that choice is a leap of faith. We will never fully know what lies below, so all we can do is take a chance and jump in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m realizing now that both songs use referencing jumping in and swimming — &amp;ldquo;Banshee Beat&amp;rdquo; opens with the line &amp;ldquo;Oh there&amp;rsquo;ll be time to get by, to get dry, after the swimming pool,&amp;rdquo; and the chorus goes,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I duck out, go down to find the swimming pool&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hop a fence, leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cause when I&amp;rsquo;m snuffed out, I doubt I&amp;rsquo;ll find a swimming pool&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hop a fence, leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water and swimming is, of course, a motif within Mac Miller&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m realizing lately that it reoccurs in my life, too; in the music I like, both lyrically and in feeling, impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe I found both of these songs when I needed to and that they may not have had the impact they did had I heard them at a different point in my life — so to return to the prompt, I think they are words of wisdom that my younger self could have used to hear, but I would perhaps not have been ready for them. Perhaps I simply needed to hear that there were smoother waters ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original prompt had a typo that I corrected, so it&amp;rsquo;s not verbatim, but it&amp;rsquo;s close enough.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My favorite bloggers are folks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://veronique.ink/&#34;&gt;Veronique&lt;/a&gt;, who captures these fleeting vignettes of her daily life, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://passerine.bearblog.dev/&#34;&gt;passerine&lt;/a&gt;, who writes with such sharp insight and beauty. That&amp;rsquo;s the sort of person I&amp;rsquo;d like to be.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

I also started moving some of the furniture in my classroom into place — I&amp;rsquo;m rearranging for next year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;received a postcard in the mail&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://buymeacoffee.com/veronique/e/280562&#34;&gt;from Veronique&lt;/a&gt;!

It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful, poetic, important text, and I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to read it with my kids. It&amp;rsquo;s heavy, and the unit I&amp;rsquo;ve planned around it is challenging, but I want to be more rigorous in my curriculum, and I think the kids will really connect with Esperanza.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blueberrylemonade.pika.page/posts/i-wanted-to-be-like-my-dad&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wanted to be like my dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Kyle (on Blueberry Lemonade).&lt;/strong&gt; A thoughtful piece on how adulthood shifts our relationships with our parents. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting — I seem to have the inverse experience: moving out of my mom&amp;rsquo;s house, I think, brought us closer in many ways. But I still connect with Kyle&amp;rsquo;s thesis about how our views of parents evolve; perhaps the nature of parenthood is seeing your child grow beyond you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A lot of &lt;strong&gt;Friends at the Table&lt;/strong&gt; content on Twitch.

      <title>Moving to a rack mount setup</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I wrote a post a few months ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/moving-my-home-server-to-a-new-chassis/&#34;&gt;cataloguing moving my home server&lt;/a&gt; from the old NZXT case I had leftover from my old PC into a Rosewill chassis that would let me, eventually, move to a proper rack setup. This past Prime Day, I purchased a Riveco 15U rack and then some sliding rails to go along with it, with the hope of finally moving the loud and hot NAS into the basement where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Putting together the rack was easy enough: there were a lot of screws, which is fine, but the assembly was straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/07/PXL_20240727_173357497.MP.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of the assembled rack&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We then took out the rails (iStarUSA TC-RAIL-26) to affix them to the rack and I discovered my error: I ordered 26&amp;quot; rails when I probably needed 20&amp;quot;. Ah well — I ordered them from eBay and wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in going through the return process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/07/PXL_20240727_185834073.MP.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a server rack with rails that are a few inches too long&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We continued through and, with just a little trouble, were able to mount the chassis within the rack and have it slide out properly. I&amp;rsquo;m indebted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/IkILNUa4HaY?si=-l90v5gEK_ojk_n1&#34;&gt;SPX Labs&amp;rsquo;s YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; showing assembly of rails and a chassis just slightly different than mine, which was a great reference. The rack does tip when the chassis is fully extended, but that&amp;rsquo;s workable for now and will resolve when I fill the rack with other equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/07/PXL_20240727_191615714.MP.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a server mounted within a rack&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we decided we were committed for the evening and turned to routing ethernet into the basement. The room I&amp;rsquo;ve designated to be the home of the rack is the former location of our oil tank; shortly after we moved in, we had the tank replaced, as it was around 60 years old and filled with sludge. We also relocated the tank because its vent and fill caps were in the garage. The tank predated the garage — the previous owners added it on. Moving the tank left this room empty, so we now have a basement storage room that&amp;rsquo;s conveniently right under our office, where our router is also currently located.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day, I&amp;rsquo;d love to wire the whole house up with ethernet, but today is not that day. We got creative (or sloppy, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure any professional network folks reading this will say): there are a bunch of unused vents throughout the house. It used to have a central fan system and, for some inexplicable reason, a previous owner ripped it out and left all the vents but not the ducts.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many of these vents run straight through into the basement,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; including one on the floor of the office, hidden by some built-in bookcases. Joe cleverly used some string for a string trimmer to pull the cable through the vent and into the basement room through a pre-existing hole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/07/PXL_20240727_194918310.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a cable coming through a wall&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With ethernet pulled down, the rack was ready to hook up. Right now I have the world&amp;rsquo;s shittiest surge protector down there, but I have a rack mounted surge protector en route to me. The ethernet is dangling, but again, down the line, I&amp;rsquo;ll get a proper network setup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/07//PXL_20240727_195827848.MP.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a server rack with an installed chassis wired up&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished the goal of getting the rack established and getting the server off the floor of my living spaces. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful the cooler basement will improve the temperatures inside the chassis, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A shame, as if the ducts were still there, we could relatively easily retrofit central air conditioning.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine came over once to help assemble some furniture, removed her rings, then dropped them straight through the vent. There was a moment of panic until we realized they just fell straight down into the basement.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to try out doing Week Notes instead of monthly wrap ups. So far, so good! As a callback to my livejournal days, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out using a random quote from something I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying this week as my title (most likely, and true to my livejournal heart, cryptic song lyrics).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My district is finally paying me to organize &lt;strong&gt;Safe Space trainings&lt;/strong&gt;. This week, I got together with two other teachers to collaborate on plans, then delivered the training to a group of folks who we also prepared to do the training themselves. An immensely rewarding experience that felt like the culmination of four years of anger and despair and turned those feelings into something positive and productive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trying to &lt;strong&gt;get organized and get on a better schedule&lt;/strong&gt;. I woke up on Friday at 2:14pm (!!!) and felt awful about it. I spent a lot of time that day organizing my calendar (digital on Todoist, and I keep a physical planner) and setting some goals for myself so I don&amp;rsquo;t spend the whole summer sleeping like a teenager.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I also want to &lt;strong&gt;cut down on my screen time for big social media apps&lt;/strong&gt; (like Instagram and Facebook) — the ones that have no value other than to waste my time. I put a big ol&amp;rsquo; screen time widget on the homescreen of my phone as a way to try to curtail the scrolling; I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that, when I unlock my phone, I&amp;rsquo;ll see that I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent a substantial amount of time on these apps and choose something else instead. I love to be online, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather &lt;strong&gt;spend that time on indie web spaces&lt;/strong&gt; like bearblog, Mastodon (I need to find folks to follow! Please send me recs and/or your account, fellow bearbloggers — my email is in the footer), and 32bitcafe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is a very long-term goal, but I want to &lt;strong&gt;migrate my curriculum map from Notion to Obsidian&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly trying to move to open source programs (to, hopefully, stave off enshittification). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects&#34;&gt;Obsidian Projects plugin&lt;/a&gt; is helping to make this a reality, but I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for a good way to create a rollup of my tags that includes the full standard text and a heatmap of how frequently the tag is used. I played a bit with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://getgrav.org/&#34;&gt;Grav&lt;/a&gt; for this but found I was going &lt;em&gt;web first&lt;/em&gt; in my approach when really I just wanted a content management system (which Obsidian is, in a way, albeit a private one).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;moved my server into a rack setup&lt;/strong&gt; and relocated it to my basement. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably put together a full post cataloguing that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Talk So Teens Will Listen &amp;amp; Listen So Teens Will Talk&lt;/em&gt; by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve read many recommendations for this book and thought it might help me in the classroom. I started and finished the book in two days — it&amp;rsquo;s a quick but valuable read. Right now, all the ideas are theoretical, as I won&amp;rsquo;t get to try them out until September, but I love the approach. The authors put into explicit steps the feeling that I&amp;rsquo;ve always had: interactions with anyone, but especially children, need to be based on mutual respect, and adults cannot expect children to control their emotions if they are not willing to do the same. I&amp;rsquo;d love to make this a book study among co-workers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://louplummer.lol/computer-people/&#34;&gt;Computer People&lt;/a&gt; by Lou Plummer&lt;/strong&gt;. A thoughtful piece about the evolution and entry of tech into our lives, particularly in education. Unfortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t share Lou&amp;rsquo;s rosy outlook: I still have lots of coworkers who don&amp;rsquo;t regard themselves as &amp;ldquo;computer people&amp;rdquo; and resist any new technology (and call me for help when something is unplugged).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, continued from last week (&lt;strong&gt;season four&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy A&lt;/em&gt; (2010)&lt;/strong&gt;. I never saw this when it came out but always read positive talk about it. It was awful; few laughs and all the character&amp;rsquo;s motivations and actions were puzzling.

I replaced it with a higher quality rip and enjoyed hearing instruments and layers I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed before. I&amp;rsquo;ve also a new appreciation for &amp;ldquo;Breaking It Up,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Hanging High,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Good, I&amp;rsquo;m Gone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to be listening to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Hell&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos!&lt;/strong&gt;, the latest release by my favorite band, but I preordered it on vinyl and it still hasn&amp;rsquo;t come in&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much longer I&amp;rsquo;ll hold out.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Red Leather&amp;rdquo; by Future &amp;amp; Metro Boomin&lt;/strong&gt;. I still don&amp;rsquo;t listen to much rap outside of Mac (a bit of Vince Staples, some Stormzy, some Princess Nokia), but I&amp;rsquo;d like to branch out. I heard this in the background of (probably) an Instagram Reel and dig it (I hate that this is how folks, myself included, are discovering music these days).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my heart of hearts, I am a lazy fucker, and I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to change that. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot I want to do during my summer break, and I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be disappointed in myself if I waste away the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; summer being a lazy fucker. I want to allow myself time to relax, but balance is important.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew enough to develop a custom flat-file static-site generator geared at teachers who want to write lesson plans in Markdown, but alas, I do not — and I imagine the market for that is fairly narrow, so I am left to repurpose other, more general tools for a fairly specific use case.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did buy the digital deluxe off Bandcamp, so I have that and can easily play it off the speakers I use for my turntable, but I also ordered new speakers for my PC, so perhaps this will be their first rodeo&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/tags/media-log/&#34;&gt;tried out doing monthly media logs&lt;/a&gt; and found it difficult to stick to; it became daunting to log everything, and I put the unnecessary onus on myself to also write down detailed thoughts on everything. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try out shorter weekly notes instead. I want to have a record of and reflect on things that are important to me, so the effort matters, but perhaps this will be easier to maintain.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to use this space to share out blog posts and other web content that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;doing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#doing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Doing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;redesigned my bearblog&lt;/strong&gt; from scratch. It&amp;rsquo;s not much different than what I had before, but it&amp;rsquo;s a dramatically simpler stylesheet. I&amp;rsquo;m also loading the css from a server and embedding that within bearblog, which means I can use my preferred app (VSCodium) to write the code and bypass the bearblog editor.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to &lt;strong&gt;get back into running&lt;/strong&gt; after I &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/breaking-silences&#34;&gt;completed The Trevor Project&amp;rsquo;s 53 mile challenge in June&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t run since then until this week. I also picked up the &lt;strong&gt;Shokz OpenRun Mini&lt;/strong&gt; on Prime Day which have been cool to try out on my runs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#reading&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Reading&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gordonhamburger.com/i-dream-of-game-pass/&#34;&gt;I dream of a better Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; by Phil Bothun&lt;/strong&gt;, a great post on Game Pass&amp;rsquo;s enshittification and how it could be more consumer-oriented&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://emmasdilemmas.bearblog.dev/emerging/&#34;&gt;Emerging&lt;/a&gt; on Emma&amp;rsquo;s Dilemmas&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s always lovely to see a new face on the bearblog discover page, and Emma&amp;rsquo;s prose is fantastic. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to read more from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cultural Competence Now&lt;/em&gt; by Vernita Mayfield.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve joined my school district&amp;rsquo;s team DEI and we&amp;rsquo;re using this book to frame our work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; (Emily Wilson translation)&lt;/strong&gt;. I taught the Gareth Hinds graphic novel version of &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; to my students at the end of this past school year. They and I enjoyed it way more than anticipated, and it motivated me to take on reading the actual text for the first time. The introduction and translator&amp;rsquo;s note in this version comprise a daunting 95 pages in my edition, so I&amp;rsquo;ve read that, Book 1, and into Book 2. I love Wilson&amp;rsquo;s ethos in approaching the translation and am enjoying it thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;watching&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#watching&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Watching&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;, season three&lt;/strong&gt; (one of the best, I think, if not the) &lt;strong&gt;and four&lt;/strong&gt; (also one of my favorites). &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt; was a staple in my house growing up: we binged it as a family when I was in middle school and then endlessly rewatched the DVD collection. A friend of mine and her daughter have been watching it together, and they recently invited me over for a &lt;em&gt;Gilmore&lt;/em&gt; night, which triggered the rewatch. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that I still love the show dearly (despite its many faults). Joe has also (voluntarily!) joined in on my rewatch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another Cinderella Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Watched with a friend for nostalgia reasons (on her part). I&amp;rsquo;m more of a Jennifer Coolidge fan, and the real life age gap between the romantic leads is disturbing — especially when Selena was a minor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;playing&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#playing&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Playing&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 1.6 update&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picross e&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/strong&gt; on my Switch, mostly when watching &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;listening&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#listening&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Listening&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRAT&lt;/em&gt;, Charli XCX&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;BRAT&lt;/em&gt; might be my album of the year; I love Charli and I think &lt;em&gt;BRAT&lt;/em&gt; is her magnum opus. &amp;ldquo;I think about it all the time&amp;rdquo; has hit particularly hard, as I&amp;rsquo;m having these same conversations with my partner right now.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Volume Beta&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Volume Alpha&lt;/em&gt;, C418&lt;/strong&gt;.

I first got into The xx in 2012, after I heard &amp;ldquo;Heart Skipped a Beat&amp;rdquo; in, I believe, an H&amp;amp;M.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was nice to return to the album and reminisce. I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how much I love &amp;ldquo;Night Time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gilmore Guys&lt;/strong&gt;. Joe loves podcasts and this one has motivated him to join me in the &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt; rewatch. I listened through to the show years ago, so it has been a little weird to revisit. We&amp;rsquo;re in their early days (season two), which is rough: many of their guests hate &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt;, which does not make for fun listening. Things get better (and, in my opinion, the podcast gets funnier) as they go on. I do find all of the singing cringy now, which I don&amp;rsquo;t recall from my first listen. &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Guys&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first podcasts I really listened to, so perhaps now I&amp;rsquo;m just much more exposed to different shows and styles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will allow myself the clemency to miss weeks, too.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bearblog editor isn&amp;rsquo;t bad by any means; it is, by design, simple. But I like to have syntax highlighting and auto-complete.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sans-international travel and pop star career, of course.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s shocking how much music I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered from retail stores. I also got into PC Music and SOPHIE after I heard &amp;ldquo;Hey QT&amp;rdquo; in an H&amp;amp;M too.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/your-silence-will-not-protect-you/&#34;&gt;Last time I updated this blog&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about silences in my professional career. These past few weeks, I feel I am doing the work to break mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am the faculty advisor for my middle school&amp;rsquo;s GSA. I have been for years now, and it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of, but this year especially I feel I have a great crop of kids that I&amp;rsquo;m really connecting with. At my town&amp;rsquo;s Pride festival in early June, my club had a booth selling crafts the kids had made to raise funds. The kids filtered in and out to help sell goods, but mostly I think they just valued having a &amp;ldquo;home base&amp;rdquo; at the event. For me, it was a long, socially draining day, but speaking to them afterward about the experience and hearing them tell me how at home they felt at the festival, how comfortable they felt being themselves, was so gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also (inadvertently) walked into orientation for our incoming students. Our guidance counselor, who was giving the presentation, asked me to talk to the kids about the clubs I run; when I mentioned Pride Club, a handful of kids immediately lit up and excitedly looked at each other. I often feel I&amp;rsquo;m not achieving as much as I could be with the club, but I have to remind myself of how much it means to those kids — even if it&amp;rsquo;s only five or ten of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In line with that, I have been pushing for the last several years for my district to mandate trainings for staff on making LGBTQ+ kids feel safe, welcomed, and affirmed. I was met at first with a lot of inaction — encouraging words but no real initiative from the people who can actually make that happen. So I decided to do it myself. I, along with some amazing colleagues and friends, adapted a training curriculum we found online and offered workshops at regional conferences. We partnered with my Alma mater to do the training for their education students. We even, through word of mouth, were contacted by a neighboring district and paid to do a workshop for them as guest presenters. I joined my district&amp;rsquo;s professional development committee to force the issue. And it worked: this summer, I will be preparing a team of my coworkers who can provide the training district-wide, with a trainer in every building.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also taken on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/why-we-ride-stories-from-our-53-mile-pride-ride/&#34;&gt;The Trevor Project&amp;rsquo;s 53 mile Pride Ride challenge&lt;/a&gt; to raise money for the organization.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve raised over $300 so far, and the challenge has motivated me to re-commit to my fitness goals. I&amp;rsquo;m at (almost) 35 miles as of writing this; I was making great progress, but the heat wave affecting upstate NY has stagnated my progress (temporarily).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, next year, I hope to join my district&amp;rsquo;s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee and push my efforts even further. I&amp;rsquo;ve put in my application to join and been (verbally) promised a seat — and convinced some of my previously jaded coworkers to also put their voices in the ring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this always comes with a lingering imposter syndrome, of course. My sexuality is not something I am generally open about professionally, and it&amp;rsquo;s not something that often comes up personally, either, being in a straight-presenting relationship. Who am I to appoint myself diversity officer? What right do I have?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But of course the work is important. Even as unqualified as I feel — as a white person, too, as my work for LGBTQ+ kids has intersected with other DEI work, especially around race — I am starting conversations and beginning the process. Hopefully one day I can take my seat on the cis white person bench knowing that I used my privilege to pave the way for others to take up the fight, knowing that I broke those initial silences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I considered linking my fundraising page, but The Trevor Project is running the fundraiser through Facebook (gross), which is linked to my actual real life identity. I have a feeling that a determined reader with too much time on their hands and a good deal of internet sleuthing ability could figure that out on their own — after all, my URL is my first name — but I still would rather not provide the direct link publicly. That said, if any readers genuinely want to contribute to the fundraiser for not-creepy reasons, feel free to shoot me an email. I feel that&amp;rsquo;s barrier enough.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked before on this blog about &lt;a href=&#34;../on-teaching/&#34;&gt;being a teacher&lt;/a&gt; and how passionate I am about my work; the time I spend with my students — which should be paramount and where all my energy goes — comes naturally. I often remark that I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m doing a stand-up comedy routine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while teaching because my goal is not only to instruct but to develop joy in learning, in reading, in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where my job suddenly becomes complicated is the &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; work, that is, everything that is not teaching my students or directly related to them (i.e. grading, preparing lessons, selecting materials, and so on). Unfortunately, teaching is an incredibly political job, as we teachers must manage our relationships with our colleagues and administrators just as much as we do with our students. It&amp;rsquo;s this part of the work that I have the least enthusiasm for and which is particularly treacherous for new teachers, as the prevailing philosophy is to keep one&amp;rsquo;s head down until tenured. That&amp;rsquo;s largely what I tried to do for my first year or two. It helped that I started in 2020, when I really &lt;em&gt;couldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; interact with my colleagues much, as many of us were working from home (and those of us working from the building were isolating within our classrooms). This was a tremendously lonely way to start in a new workplace, and certainly many of my colleagues were not as fastidious as I was about following COVID regulations in those first years, but they had the pre-existing relationships that made it more acceptable to step into someone&amp;rsquo;s space for idle conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in my tenure year, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed some close professional relationships (mostly with newer, like-minded teachers around my age). I don&amp;rsquo;t feel as isolated, and I&amp;rsquo;m much more comfortable with passing conversation in the faculty room and hallways. My willingness to keep my mouth shut and not make waves, however, has waned. In a committee meeting a few weeks ago, conversation spiraled away from our ostensible focus — district-wide professional development needs — and into the workplace practices of some employees that prevent schools from being welcoming and affirming environments. The conversation involved folks mostly of the same dispositions as me&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at various stages of their careers: early career (me), middle career, old-dog veterans, and administrators. The conversation was cathartic, and the ruling message that bubbled to the surface was that it was beyond time to tolerate those teachers who do not treat their students with respect and who are not committed to social justice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe in that message, and that meeting was a bright spot in a low moment for me; I often feel bogged down by managing the politics of my job as an untenured teacher, by the constant negotiation of pushing back on toxic practices but not making a name for myself as an agitator lest it jeopardize my job. I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in many situations — years ago and recently — where I&amp;rsquo;ve had to make the choice between standing up for what I believed in (at the risk of upsetting coworkers and administrators) and what would keep me safe. The wisdom many have given me was that the best thing I can do for my students is to stay employed, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve swallowed a lot of bitter pills and allowed behavior to continue that I find at best disrespectful and at worst disgusting as it perpetuates systems of exclusion and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost four years in and on the verge of receiving tenure, my patience for this has evaporated. In some ways, that feeling is invigorating; I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to no longer biting my tongue, and of course I must consider how the victims of my silence are my students. At last I feel I can do right by them and speak up. However, I must also prepare myself for the difficulty in being that agitator. I believe in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/micah_wonjoon_kessel_two_in_the_room_radical_change_without_changing_radicals&#34;&gt;the power of two in the room&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly difficult to be the first person to speak up — and to face the personal and professional consequences of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fight is worth fighting, however. I open and close on &lt;a href=&#34;https://caps.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Audre%20Lorde%20-%20Silence%20Into%20Action.pdf&#34;&gt;the immortal words of Audre Lorde in &amp;ldquo;The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In becoming forcibly and essentially aware of my own morality, and of what I wished and wanted for my life, however short it might be, priorities and omissions became strongly etched in a merciless light, and what I most regretted were my silences. Of what had I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; been afraid? To question or to speak as I believed could have meant pain, or death. But we all hurt in so many different ways, all the time, and pain will either change or end. Death, on the other hand, is the final silence. And that might be coming quicky, now, without regard for whether I had ever spoken what needed to be said, or had only betrayed myself into small silences, while I planned someday to speak, or waited for someone else&amp;rsquo;s words. And I began to recognize a source of power within myself that comes from the knowledge that while it is most desirable not to be afraid, learning to put fear into perspective gave me great strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was going to die, if not sooner than later, whether or not I had ever spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you&amp;hellip; Because the machine will try to grind you into dust anyway, whether or not we speak. We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and our selves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My stand-up routine for my students is heavy on audience participation, which, I&amp;rsquo;m told, is the lowest form of comedy.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bleeding heart, leftist wokies.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Moving my home server to a new chassis</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I have a home server (running Unraid) that I use to backup computers, as media storage, and to run various apps. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly been cobbled together from used parts I found for cheap, and it generally followed &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/guide-nas-killer-4-0-fast-quiet-power-efficient-and-flexible-starting-at-125/667&#34;&gt;Serverbuild&amp;rsquo;s NAS Killer 4 guide&lt;/a&gt;. It runs like a dream, and putting it together is one of the best decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made. More recently, with streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu, etc. cracking down on password sharing, it has become my pathway to shedding some monthly subscriptions and owning my own media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, that server has lived in an old NZXT case that I had used when I built my first PC, primarily because I had the case laying around and because it still had bays for 3.5&amp;quot; drives (most modern PC cases only include one or two and instead provide storage for 2.5&amp;quot; drives). That bulky case has been shoved away in whatever corner of my apartments I could find, but now that I own a house, I have dreams of setting up a proper server rack in a closet somewhere. My home&amp;rsquo;s basement has a strange little room that housed only the oil tank and is conveniently right below my office space, so that&amp;rsquo;s the intended home. We replaced and relocated the tank and ran electrical to it, so it&amp;rsquo;s now good to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I purchased a rack mount case (Rosewill RSV-L4500U) off of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/&#34;&gt;hardwareswap&lt;/a&gt; Discord not too long ago and intended to move the server when I had some free time. Just a few days ago, I found that one of my 6TB drives was throwing errors in Unraid. I ran a SMART test, which seemed to clear, so I thought I would start by checking the physical connections — and if I was going to have to take the server down, I might as well move it into the new case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Easy enough, right? I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with and building PCs for over ten years now. I&amp;rsquo;m at a stage where I can put one together and confidently turn it on on the first try. There was a bit of an adjustment period to a proper server case (particularly the drive cages — I like the idea of them, but the screwless design is a proper pain in the ass), but for the most part, this was smooth sailing — at least in the context of what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/02/PXL_20240219_164002815.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The new case&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https:///cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/02/PXL_20240219_164215573.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The old server&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https:///cdn.cassie.ink/images/2024/02/PXL_20240219_180817832.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Transferred&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m normally better at straightening up the cables, but with a non-modular PSU, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of options. I&amp;rsquo;ll replace it one day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, part of what I wanted to do was also replace my cache drive. I had been running it off of an &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; 120GB SSD which would fill up pretty easily. I had a 500GB SSD kicking around to swap to; I had thought I&amp;rsquo;d set my appdata folder to copy to my array so that I could just pop in the new drive, remove the old one, and be good to go. This was my fatal error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I boot up the server — first try — and see the new cache drive needs to be formatted. Great. I do so, then check my Dockers. &lt;em&gt;Everything is gone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh fuck — but I can just put in the old drive, right? I do so. It is, according to Unraid, unmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I had switched from an xfs file system to btrfs with the new drive. Maybe I just need to set the cache pool to accept xfs again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drive is still unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try &lt;code&gt;xfs_repair&lt;/code&gt; on it with no luck. I spent several hours trying all kinds of drive recovery and tricks online. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This resulted in me having to recreate all of my Docker containers — all of my -arr setups, my Plex configuration (including all of my playlists), etc. It took &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;, but I learned my lesson: all of that is set to automatically backup now. If I&amp;rsquo;m looking for silver linings, this finally forced me to migrate from Jackett to Prowlarr, which removes a lot of manual configuration on my part; my indexers all automatically sync to Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s a pain in the ass, and something is still off with my Lidarr config, but again, lessons learned&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, the supposed failed drive is running just fine and passing all checks and tests. I&amp;rsquo;m getting frequent warnings that some of the drives are running hot, so I&amp;rsquo;m planning to replace the stock fans (which I&amp;rsquo;ve read some folks online confirming that they&amp;rsquo;re awful) with Arctic P12s. Further down the line, I need to get a proper rack and run cables down to my &amp;ldquo;server room&amp;rdquo; (old furnace room in my basement) — for now, the server will continue to live on the floor of my office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;@jamesmckz &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jamesmckz/status/1764778536244507081&#34;&gt;shared the following challenge on X&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No cheating - your Quietus style Bakers Dozen. 13 albums (off the top of your head) to know you by. Not looking for a perfect list, looking for a list that you instantly regret posting because you then remember something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I approached my response largely as a list of albums that have meant something to me in my life — not necessarily what I&amp;rsquo;m actively listening to at the moment. Many of these albums I&amp;rsquo;ve not listened to much in years, but I consider them pivotal, essential listening for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/album/we-are-beautiful-we-are-doomed-remastered-edition&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos!&lt;/a&gt; - Los Campesinos! has been my favorite band since I was 13. I found them when I chanced upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K12AvBXJMSo&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Death to Los Campesinos!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; airing on mtvU; I spent the following few years obsessed, exploring their (at the time  limited) discography and spiderwebbing through related acts (Slow Club, Xiu Xiu, Johnny Foreigner, Animal Collective — those often mentioned in the same breath or who dominated indie spaces at the time). &lt;em&gt;WAB, WAD&lt;/em&gt; released when I was 14 years old and it marked me, as albums that release when you&amp;rsquo;re 14 do. LC!&amp;rsquo;s more recent releases receive more frequent plays for me these days, but &lt;em&gt;WAB, WAD&lt;/em&gt; holds a special place: it&amp;rsquo;s brash and cheeky, blending the hyperactive indie pop of &lt;em&gt;Hold On Now, Youngster&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; with the more mature, refined palates of what would come.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/album/sick-scenes&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos!&lt;/a&gt; - As of writing, &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt; is LC!&amp;rsquo;s most recent, though not for long.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s probably my all-around favorite release of theirs; it retains their signature mix of smart-mouth lyrics and  overly-affected melodrama but beautifully pulls back the instrumentation. &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt; is almost sparse in places, evoking a maturity in sound that distinguishes it from some of their earlier discography.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It feels like LC! for the adult me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sylvanesso.bandcamp.com/album/sylvan-esso&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sylvan Esso&lt;/em&gt;, Sylvan Esso&lt;/a&gt; - I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how I found &amp;ldquo;Hey Mami,&amp;rdquo; but the moment I stumbled upon it, I remember thinking to myself, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is all I&amp;rsquo;m about from now on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s infectiously catchy, and Sylvan Esso has an incredibly organic vocals and groovy beats. I listened to the album on and off for years, different tracks holding special esteem at different moments of my life. More recently, I bought the album on vinyl, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably been the most played of my collection. It&amp;rsquo;s my go-to for a chill evening, for a pick me up, for sharing music with just about any friend who walks in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzAjXdBJsEc&amp;amp;list=OLAK5uy_nDheeuXYg9hksmCezWxswPTivVoqyNCQc&amp;amp;index=2&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt;, Mac Miller&lt;/a&gt; - I came to Mac after he died, and by that I mean &lt;em&gt;right after&lt;/em&gt;. I saw the headlines announcing his overdose and despite knowing hardly anything about him (and not really listening to rap), I was shaken. I dove into his discography, and since then, he&amp;rsquo;s become my second most-streamed artist of all time. I go back and forth with his discography — sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m obsessed with &lt;em&gt;Faces&lt;/em&gt;, others &lt;em&gt;Watching Movies with the Sound Off&lt;/em&gt;, lately &lt;em&gt;GO:OD AM&lt;/em&gt; — but I always come back to &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt;. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s his most complete, most mature album.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s a zero-skip album for me (except for maybe &amp;ldquo;Come Back to Earth&amp;rdquo; — it feels like an intro, not a song), which is rare, even among this list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slowclub.bandcamp.com/album/yeah-so-2&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah So&lt;/em&gt;, Slow Club&lt;/a&gt; - In the throes of my early teen obsession with Los Campesinos!, Slow Club was a close number two. I spent the summer of 2008 chatting on AIM with an online friend and listening to scarcely anything else. We loved the same music and exchanged lyrics and obsessions back and forth. &lt;em&gt;Yeah So&lt;/em&gt; takes me back to then, to friendship and simpler times.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kqYBQ3_sL9I0u1AHthqWA4yzqa19l9OPI&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;, Bloc Party&lt;/a&gt; - I feel I have little to say about &lt;em&gt;Silent Alarm&lt;/em&gt;, comparatively, other than it fucking rocks. To me, it&amp;rsquo;s still the best of Bloc Party&amp;rsquo;s releases, and it&amp;rsquo;s another album with virtually zero skips.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joannanewsom.bandcamp.com/album/ys&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ys&lt;/em&gt;, Joanna Newsom&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Ys&lt;/em&gt; is a juggernaut — absolutely critical listening. It&amp;rsquo;s deep and daunting, with writing that sets my English teacher brain alight. When I try to expose friends to Joanna, I play them &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/DQSbjJ6EVmw?si=VTXSlegaUb9DD17y&amp;amp;t=356&#34;&gt;my favorite portion of &amp;ldquo;Only Skin,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; hoping to win them over with the phenomenal prosody and abstract, imaginative lyricism (&amp;ldquo;Awful atoll — / O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow! / Bawl bellow: / Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow / Toddle and roll / Teeth an impalpable bit of leather / while yarrow, heather and hollyhock awkwardly molt along the shore&amp;rdquo;), the jubilant and embattled refrain of &amp;ldquo;Being a woman, being a woman.&amp;rdquo; Joanna is an artist, and that artistry has grown and evolved since &lt;em&gt;Ys&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Ys&lt;/em&gt; is pivotal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kHjqL8bBNaNPRD5pNivPR3z8xDvlsq54Y&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;how i&amp;rsquo;m feeling now&lt;/em&gt;, Charli XCX&lt;/a&gt; - Charli is a more recent addition to my all-timers; I&amp;rsquo;ve still not really fully dived into her discography, but I love her rambunctious pop; to me, it&amp;rsquo;s the most successful (while still faithful) mainstream interpretation of the PC Music sound and ethos. &lt;em&gt;how i&amp;rsquo;m feeling&lt;/em&gt; is the most consistent of Charli&amp;rsquo;s releases for me, and I first heard it shortly after its release, making it particularly timely, as an album primarily written and recorded during early days of the pandemic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://theperipheralones.bandcamp.com/album/chants&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt;, The Peripheral Ones&lt;/a&gt; - This is the most esoteric of my bullshit. I made it a point in my teen years to find the most obscure music possible that was also somewhat listenable. That took me frequently to sites like purevolume and Myspace, where I looked for artists with small followings. I somehow stumbled upon The Middle Ones, and they became a relic of my music library that I&amp;rsquo;d revisit from time to time. In 2015, I saw someone shared a link to &lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt;, an album of Middle Ones covers, on the now-defunct anorak forums. I positively love these covers, which are clear products of love and reverence that still experiment and innovate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nc7cL6f0gnfXWLhVfTlzo_gL9xlkaJJ74&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Sickness &amp;amp; In Flames&lt;/em&gt;, The Front Bottoms&lt;/a&gt; - I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in the concept of guilty pleasures, but if I did, The Front Bottoms would be mine. I know they&amp;rsquo;re not good. I know Brian Sella can&amp;rsquo;t sing. But what else am I meant to do with lyrics like &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll always be my girlfriend / Even after we get married / And no matter how sad I am / I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make you happy&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lUsDgd77iAxl2thSkCvOtx-uSAJ41cz1M&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt;, Grimes&lt;/a&gt; - I am deeply uncomfortable calling myself a Grimes fan post-Elon (probably pre- too, if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest — Grimes has been on her bullshit for a long time). I was no stranger to weird shit when I started listening to Grimes, but Grimes was a &lt;em&gt;new kind&lt;/em&gt; of weird bullshit for me. In &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; especially, the vocals and lyrics are at times abstracted and indistinct. They’re like another instrument, layered into wandering synthesizers and catchy beats. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is a huge, remarkable album made by a deeply problematic person. I&amp;rsquo;m allowed a few of those.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nBHJOcm_3m37RgVj_BZ2mtwg9QTkbv-qA&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Awesome Wave&lt;/em&gt;, alt+J&lt;/a&gt; - When I think of albums that instantly transport me back to an era of my life, &lt;em&gt;An Awesome Wave&lt;/em&gt; is up there. I listened to the record a bunch in my first year of college, a time where I was clawing out of the deepest depression of my life and beginning to figure out who I wanted to be. alt+J is passé, these days, but at the time, they were a fresh wave for me — musically and emotionally.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://xiuxiu.bandcamp.com/album/dear-god-i-hate-myself&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear God, I Hate Myself&lt;/em&gt;, Xiu Xiu&lt;/a&gt; - By contrast, Xiu Xiu is what I was listening to when I was incredibly depressed and unhappy, to the point where I swore off of them for a few years as I tried to get to a better place, mentally. &lt;em&gt;Dear God, I Hate Myself&lt;/em&gt; has crept itself back, but it&amp;rsquo;s another one that&amp;rsquo;s indicative and evocative of an era of my life that is etched in memory and that I am glad to have left behind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presented in no particular order and, as the prompt outlines, with a lot of regrets.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Los Campesinos! announced their seventh full LP a few weeks ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which I love dearly; reflecting on this list, I&amp;rsquo;m debating with myself as to whether this should really be &lt;em&gt;Romance is Boring&lt;/em&gt; and  I&amp;rsquo;m full of baloney.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given that it is the last he released before he passed.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I read a thread online recently about bisexuality: folks were discussing use of the label compared to something like pansexual. Many folks within the LGBTQ+ umbrella argue that pansexual is a more inclusive label than bisexual, as &lt;em&gt;bi-&lt;/em&gt; upholds a binary view of gender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My relationship with my bisexuality has been fraught. I can pinpoint in specificity where I feel it started: in the sixth grade (for me, 2005 or 2006), reading the sex ed chapter in my science textbook, I was presented with the three sexualities — heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. I had, by that point, already started puberty and experienced low-level attraction. I&amp;rsquo;d been confused that that attraction never seemed to have a distinct target: I liked boys and I liked girls. I remember an immediate sense of comfort and belonging in the term. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s allowed?&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. Reading it in a textbook made it seem so simple. &lt;em&gt;Then surely that&amp;rsquo;s the way to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through the rest of middle and high school, I continued to experience attraction in this way, but the word suddenly felt more complicated. I lived in an extremely conservative town; there were only a handful of openly queer kids, and I was inundated with queerphobic messaging — that bisexuality was just a phase, that everyone is a little bicurious during puberty. I digested it and refused the label, even as friends privately insisted to me that being in love with Natalie Portman wasn&amp;rsquo;t something straight women experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This confusion and my (mostly unrelated) depression throughout high school made me uninterested in dating. When I finally graduated and moved on to college, the question became more pressing. I found myself seeking out spaces, both physically and digital, for queer people. My fleeting college friendships of the time were all with queer people. I found safety and comfort there, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why — I continued to insist I was straight and merely engaging in feminist allyship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final breaking point was, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit ashamed to say, watching an episode of &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt;. In &amp;ldquo;What Was Missing,&amp;rdquo; Marceline and Princess Bubblegum&amp;rsquo;s past relationship becomes queer at least subtextually (but almost explicitly). I found myself crying, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why; ruminating over it hours later, I realized what I was feeling was affirmation and euphoria. I returned back to the emotion I felt upon seeing the word &lt;em&gt;bisexual&lt;/em&gt; in that textbook all those years ago, the simple acknowledgement and acceptance. It was the last time my sexuality made sense to me, and here again I felt that same emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally accepted myself as bisexual from then on — I was 19 years old. I &amp;ldquo;came out&amp;rdquo; to a few online friends. but I felt some hang-ups identifying as such when I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been with any women (or anyone at that point — at least in any real way). It didn&amp;rsquo;t feel necessary to proclaim to the world just yet, but there was a solace in finally seeing myself as I am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I&amp;rsquo;d meet my current partner, a cisgender man, and the label started to become more complicated. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I had any right to consider myself bisexual if I&amp;rsquo;d never been with any women, and really, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I had to think about all that often, being in a straight-presenting relationship.  I continued to experience attraction to women (within the bounds of a monogamous relationship), but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel all that important to me to define.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started my teaching job, I put a pride flag up in my room. I knew seeing it would matter to some kids, and I wanted my classroom to be an inclusive space. That snowballed into me starting the school&amp;rsquo;s GSA because I was apparently the only teacher in the building who had shown any open support for the LGBTQ+ community and willingness to sign a name to it. I&amp;rsquo;m not open about my bisexuality to my students or coworkers, however, because it simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel relevant&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; and again, there was a guilt in being in a straight-passing relationship: I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to tell anyone how I identified because I could hide under the guise of heterosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to be out or open because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in a relationship that requires it. I told a friend that I considered myself bisexual recently and shared some of the asterisks on that identity that I&amp;rsquo;ve described here, adding that I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what coming out looks like anymore in 2023&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But then, being around friends that I know &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; and being open about that part of my identity gives me that same comfort I felt in that textbook all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So returning back to the word itself and whether it is or isn&amp;rsquo;t inclusive: for me, there&amp;rsquo;s a long history with the word &lt;em&gt;bisexual&lt;/em&gt; that I can&amp;rsquo;t erase. There&amp;rsquo;s an attachment that I can&amp;rsquo;t discount. I experience different attraction to different genders, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to gel with pansexuality to me. And perhaps the label shares somethings in common with the word biweekly; confusing, unclear, and in need of further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider this my explanation: it&amp;rsquo;s about what it means to me, the spirit of the word if not the technical meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not relevant to me outside of the club, I should say; I will tell the kids within the club because we have an established &amp;ldquo;Vegas rule.&amp;rdquo; Outside of that, it feels like personal, private business that isn&amp;rsquo;t relevant to my teaching. As I&amp;rsquo;ve said to coworkers who know, &amp;ldquo;the kids don&amp;rsquo;t need to know who I&amp;rsquo;m fucking on the weekends.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conversation happened a few months ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Early thoughts on Pokémon Unbound</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I downloaded &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Unbound&lt;/em&gt; the other day to play alongside my partner. We are both big &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans — like buy the new games every year fans — though my interest has waned over the last few years (I loved &lt;em&gt;Legends Arceus&lt;/em&gt; and generally felt that &lt;em&gt;Scarlet/Violet&lt;/em&gt; were slaps in the face&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). I have fond memories of the classic games, and I&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot of positive buzz about &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain that this is the first proper ROM hack I&amp;rsquo;ve played, not counting a few randomizers that I&amp;rsquo;ve cooked up for fun (and, for the most part, played for an afternoon or two and abandoned). &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly feature-rich and ambitious; it adds a great deal of quality of life options as well as formidable challenge options for the hardcore&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I fall into the category of a more casual fan, so I was pleased to see things like effectiveness and STAB indicators hacked into the &lt;em&gt;Fire Red/Leaf Green&lt;/em&gt; engine. &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; also introduces a mission log and proper side quests; what I saw did not innovate much beyond fetch quests and &amp;ldquo;do this thing x amount of times then come back,&amp;rdquo; but some had short but charming stories to follow (like the Sandslash stealing food from a local family).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; also has an original story that consumes a considerable amount of the player&amp;rsquo;s time. There&amp;rsquo;s a (for a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game) lengthy introduction cutscene that tells of the history of the region, and the player is introduced to a rogue organization that is aiming to capture the legendary birds to activate some doomsday device that will engulf the region in darkness. For &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, the broad strokes aren&amp;rsquo;t far off from something like &lt;em&gt;X/Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story — evil guy wants to destroy the world for some reason and you must stop them. I found the story mostly beneath notice, unfortunately; the game introduced a bunch of characters early on, and it is hard to care much about them when you have so many. In the opening hours of the game, for example, you meet your rival and Professor Log. Your rival is pretty standard &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; faire: brash and driven and uninterested in listening to the Professor&amp;rsquo;s advice, unlike the silent protagonist. Professor Log sends you off on various errands, one of which is to check in with his friend Arthur in the next town over, an expert on the history of the region; Arthur then introduces you to Jax, yet another young and ambitious trainer; and that&amp;rsquo;s not counting all of the villains and various gangs you meet in the introductory hours. I have some faith that &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; has unique plans for these characters in the narrative, but the balance between clicking through story and actually engaging in the exploring and battling feels skewed: &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; is dragged down by the weight of its ambition to be a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game with a story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feeling therefore disengaged by the story, what was left for me was the rote &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; experience: build and train a team to take on the gyms and various Team Rocket-like factions. I was pleased by the variety of Pokémon available to the player: &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; includes all Pokémon from Gens 1-7. I have a big blind spot for Gens 4 and 5&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the modern games have done little to introduce me to those Pokémon, opting instead to mostly focus on a new set of creatures for their respective regions.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Pokémon available to me in &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; therefore felt fresh, and the game encouraged me to try out Pokémon that I ordinarily probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider for my team. Each route and area also boasts a considerable number of Pokémon available to the player: it&amp;rsquo;s far from the usual experience in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, where you&amp;rsquo;re offered mostly Pidgey- and Rattata-likes in the early routes that you battle dozens of times. There are diverse options that feel like deep cuts turned viable team members. As someone who likes to sweep a route and catch (or at least see) all of the available Pokémon, it was a little overwhelming to have ten to twenty different ones in a relatively small area, but variety is good! I also appreciated that the trainers in each area seemed to mostly have Pokémon that were available to catch in that area. It felt authentic: of course the teams of those folks would have mostly been caught and assembled from the local fauna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, my interest in continuing with &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; has waned. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s solely a fault of the game, however: it does a lot of interesting things, and I admire the work and ambition of the team behind it. I&amp;rsquo;m just not sure how much energy I personally have for the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; formula. &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; adds its own seasoning into the mix, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t innovate — and that&amp;rsquo;s my frustration with GameFreak&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; releases too. Every game feels like going through the same motions again and again, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve just lost my enthusiasm for that.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Every now and then I&amp;rsquo;m in the right mood for it (and that mood at best lasts a few days) or something feels fresh and clicks, but &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; — and really any recent mainline &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game — so rarely fulfills that. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much further I&amp;rsquo;ll continue on with &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; — I only made it a little ways beyond the first gym, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel quite like giving the game its fair shake, but I also am trying to release myself from the sense of obligation to soldier on with something that isn&amp;rsquo;t grabbing me. There&amp;rsquo;s a line there of not always expecting immediate gratification and showing some patience, but if after a few hours I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the magic, it is increasingly hard to dedicate my limited time for gaming to something that isn&amp;rsquo;t clicking when there&amp;rsquo;s so much more out there.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain that this is the first proper ROM hack I&amp;rsquo;ve played, not counting a few randomizers that I&amp;rsquo;ve cooked up for fun (and, for the most part, played for an afternoon or two and abandoned). &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly feature-rich and ambitious; it adds a great deal of quality of life options as well as formidable challenge options for the hardcore&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I fall into the category of a more casual fan, so I was pleased to see things like effectiveness and STAB indicators hacked into the &lt;em&gt;Fire Red/Leaf Green&lt;/em&gt; engine. &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; also introduces a mission log and proper side quests; what I saw did not innovate much beyond fetch quests and &amp;ldquo;do this thing x amount of times then come back,&amp;rdquo; but some had short but charming stories to follow (like the Sandslash stealing food from a local family).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; also has an original story that consumes a considerable amount of the player&amp;rsquo;s time. There&amp;rsquo;s a (for a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game) lengthy introduction cutscene that tells of the history of the region, and the player is introduced to a rogue organization that is aiming to capture the legendary birds to activate some doomsday device that will engulf the region in darkness. For &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, the broad strokes aren&amp;rsquo;t far off from something like &lt;em&gt;X/Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s story — evil guy wants to destroy the world for some reason and you must stop them. I found the story mostly beneath notice, unfortunately; the game introduced a bunch of characters early on, and it is hard to care much about them when you have so many. In the opening hours of the game, for example, you meet your rival and Professor Log. Your rival is pretty standard &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; faire: brash and driven and uninterested in listening to the Professor&amp;rsquo;s advice, unlike the silent protagonist. Professor Log sends you off on various errands, one of which is to check in with his friend Arthur in the next town over, an expert on the history of the region; Arthur then introduces you to Jax, yet another young and ambitious trainer; and that&amp;rsquo;s not counting all of the villains and various gangs you meet in the introductory hours. I have some faith that &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; has unique plans for these characters in the narrative, but the balance between clicking through story and actually engaging in the exploring and battling feels skewed: &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; is dragged down by the weight of its ambition to be a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game with a story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feeling therefore disengaged by the story, what was left for me was the rote &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; experience: build and train a team to take on the gyms and various Team Rocket-like factions. I was pleased by the variety of Pokémon available to the player: &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; includes all Pokémon from Gens 1-7. I have a big blind spot for Gens 4 and 5&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the modern games have done little to introduce me to those Pokémon, opting instead to mostly focus on a new set of creatures for their respective regions.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Pokémon available to me in &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt; therefore felt fresh, and the game encouraged me to try out Pokémon that I ordinarily probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider for my team.

I enjoy the design of the game and the way it breaks up the conventional &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; format, but the absolute mess that the games were on a technical level felt insulting. I know that making games isn&amp;rsquo;t easy and that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of unhealthy workplace practices that go into this — something something capitalism is the real enemy — but the fact that the games still have not received a meaningful performance patch while DLC is shoveled out reeks of the worst gaming industry bullshit I can imagine.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GameFreak could learn a thing or two: I generally feel that Pokémon&amp;rsquo;s primary audience is and always will be children, so the entitled contingent of hardcore fanboys who want EV/IV training to be necessary and baked into the Pokémon experience are full of shit. However, some simple difficulty toggles (or at least settings for Exp. Share) would go a long way. I don&amp;rsquo;t think gaming companies should kowtow to toxicity, but robust difficulty and accessibility settings benefit everyone.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I played a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of Gen 2 as a kid, a fair amount of Gen 1 (mostly through &lt;em&gt;Fire Red&lt;/em&gt;), and a lot of Gen 3. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a DS for a long time, so Gens 4 and 5 passed me by; my partner got me back in with Gen 6.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this as a bad thing! I like seeing the new Pokémon introduced each gen, but there&amp;rsquo;s a swath of totally underutilized Pokémon out there because for years each gen felt it necessary to introduce 100+ new creatures.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scarlet&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Violet&lt;/em&gt; meaningful progress, but see Footnote 1.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ByI downloaded &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Unbound&lt;/em&gt; the other day to play alongside my partner. We are both big &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans — like buy the new games every year fans — though my interest has waned over the last few years (I loved &lt;em&gt;Legends Arceus&lt;/em&gt; and generally felt that &lt;em&gt;Scarlet/Violet&lt;/em&gt; were slaps in the face&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). I have fond memories of the classic games, and I&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot of positive buzz about &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

By this season, we are well passed the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; seasons, but it&amp;rsquo;s still entertaining enough to watch — if only to count how many more car crashes the writers will introduce as plot lines. I think the early (1-4) seasons are a decent watch, but at this point, I&amp;rsquo;m really just seeing it through to the end. Season seven has a novelty in seeing how a show pivots after losing its main character. I don&amp;rsquo;t think &lt;em&gt;OTH&lt;/em&gt; did so gracefully; they elevated some, generously, background characters into the main act and lumped on bunch of new ones at that. Some work better than others, but at least I&amp;rsquo;m almost at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitchen Nightmares&lt;/em&gt; (2023)&lt;/strong&gt; - Years ago, I once came home to find my partner watching &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Nightmares&lt;/em&gt; on YouTube. He&amp;rsquo;s generally not a fan of reality or competition shows, so I asked him why he was watching it. He giggled and said, &amp;ldquo;He [Gordon] just gets so mad.&amp;rdquo; That led to me also watching a bunch of the show. This month I watched a gabi belle video in which she talked about the reboot, so I dipped in too. Gordon does indeed still get mad. When watching &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Nightmares&lt;/em&gt;, I am always thinking of how much fun the show must be to edit. The editors make liberal use of the most unhinged sound effects imaginable. It&amp;rsquo;s junk food TV, and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love junk food?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve been casually rewatching as my background noise / take a nap on the couch TV. Still hilarious and as good as the first time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/strong&gt; - Two of my friends are big fans, so I&amp;rsquo;m watching the current season with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen any &lt;em&gt;Bachelor&lt;/em&gt; properties before this; I&amp;rsquo;m mostly along for the ride. The show has yet to hit the reality TV highs that keep me looped in to shows like &lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Model&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt;, and the whole concept still feels quite skeezy to me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Music&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;III&lt;/em&gt;, The Lumineers&lt;/strong&gt; - I have liked some of The Lumineers&amp;rsquo; hits for years, but a friend really loves them, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give &lt;em&gt;III&lt;/em&gt; a shot. I understand it&amp;rsquo;s a concept album with stories and characters; I really haven&amp;rsquo;t delved into that. I&amp;rsquo;m unsure if that&amp;rsquo;s because I haven&amp;rsquo;t found it compelling or because I am trying to focus more on the &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; rather than just the words (I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more for the latter). &lt;em&gt;III&lt;/em&gt; sounds great; it reminds me of how much I love the piano. It&amp;rsquo;s the focal point of many songs on the album but also beautifully interspersed as a twinkly highlight or backdrop. Particular favorites are &amp;ldquo;Donna&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;My Cell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KOpAnAMMA&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;another summer&lt;/em&gt; (Nightcore Edition)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;neverknowsbest&lt;/strong&gt; - I didnt know what nightcore was until now. neverknowsbest is a friend&amp;rsquo;s project and I really liked their debut album, so I gave this a shot. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I really &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; nightcore, but I&amp;rsquo;m constantly impressed by how talented my friends are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modal Soul&lt;/em&gt;, Nujabes&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to a lot of Nujabes-adjacent and inspired acts for years now (Tycho, emancipator, aether, Little People, etc.) but never the man himself. &lt;em&gt;Modal Soul&lt;/em&gt; had some good moments (I love &amp;ldquo;Feather&amp;rdquo;), but it was mostly background noise that bordered on repetitive. Disappointed, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try more Nujabes eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never Hungover Again&lt;/em&gt;, Joyce Manor&lt;/strong&gt; - I love this album. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and to the point; no song overstays its welcome. Each track exists just long enough to get a catchy tune through your ears then exits gracefully. I absolutely love &amp;ldquo;Heart Tattoo&amp;rdquo; in particular, to the point where I&amp;rsquo;m actually considering getting one (maybe, sort of, not really, but also I might just).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buds&lt;/em&gt;, Mom Jeans&lt;/strong&gt; - I had high hopes for this group based on the band name and that they are often mentioned in the same breath as Joyce Manor. &lt;em&gt;Best Buds&lt;/em&gt; was a disappointment; the only song I found somewhat tolerable was &amp;ldquo;Edward 40hands,&amp;rdquo; but the rest is plagued by cloyingly nasal vocals that drag down some pleasant guitar licks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;last.fm listening report: &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/lastfm/lastfm-2024-01.png&#34;&gt;https://cdn.cassie.ink/lastfm/lastfm-2024-01.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;movies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#movies&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Movies&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - an enjoyable entry in the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; series, and I can officially say that I&amp;rsquo;m caught up (aside from &lt;em&gt;Hobbes &amp;amp; Shaw&lt;/em&gt;; maybe that will feature later on this list). It&amp;rsquo;s by far not the best &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; movie (I think that&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;Fast Five&lt;/em&gt;), and I don&amp;rsquo;t really care for Jason Momoa as a villain. There&amp;rsquo;s something tired and a little problematic about the &amp;ldquo;wacky sociopath&amp;rdquo; trope, but the flair for drama and action is alive and well in this film. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely the best of the post-7 films, but I can see how some might be turned off by the copious fan service and many celebrity cameos. Personally, I come to these films for cheap thrills and excess; I know what I&amp;rsquo;m in for and don&amp;rsquo;t begrudge them for indulging that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saltburn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - a friend has been obsessed with this film and we finally sat down to watch it. It was horrifying (in a good way) and beautifully shot (even if I don&amp;rsquo;t love the choice to put it in 4:3). I don&amp;rsquo;t often like the movies I watch (the ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; movies I guess); I hesitate to say that I &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; this one so much as found it interesting and enjoyable. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d watch it again or recommend it to others. I appreciate that it was coherent and accessible in its themes compared to something like &lt;em&gt;The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt; (which I hated)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which often feels like it is showing you weird shit just to show you weird shit. &lt;em&gt;Saltburn&lt;/em&gt; knows the themes it wants to explore and presents then well to the audience. Barry looks way too old, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Watched is a generous term; this was more &amp;ldquo;talked through at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d seen the former several times already and have some affection for it. I&amp;rsquo;d not seen &lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/em&gt; before; it didn&amp;rsquo;t really capture my interest, but then, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really try either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only thing &lt;em&gt;Saltburn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt; have in common is prominently featuring a jerk off scene, I think.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I was born and raised on Long Island in a hamlet that rests along the Great South Bay.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Known to most as a ferry town, this charming suburb lives and breathes the ocean. Most every resident has access to some kind of boat, whether through personal ownership or advantageous friendship. In the 90s, the town was voted the &amp;ldquo;friendliest town in America,&amp;rdquo; a slogan that still adorns the sign as you drive into town, by a mysterious group that awards such superlatives. That accolade, along with our yacht clubs, country clubs, lack of racial diversity, and generalized fear of anything outside the norm makes the town the near picture of 1950s suburban ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In high school, the boys play football and the girls cheer them on; they graduate, marry, inherit the estate of their landed parents (who go on to relocate to the Hamptons or some other rich, desirable location), and have children of their own, thus completing their cyclical destiny. They do not fight. They do not divorce. They do not struggle, financially. They avoid anything seen as even slightly improper, for fear of damaging their social standing. And should the rebellious teenager stray out of line, their indiscretions quickly disappear, through privilege and influence and money. These people live happily trapped in their ticky-tacky homes and in their ticky-tacky lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have always felt at odds with that world. In high school, for an English class free-write, I composed an essay likening the residents of the town with vampires whose venom sucked anything interesting or genuine from a person. I did not fit within the grand picture of conformity and normalcy. I wanted to break out, to rip at its edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the town&amp;rsquo;s carefully honed image was in flux; insularity was at threat. Manhattan was constantly encroaching, bringing along its noise, its commercialism. Drive just five minutes out of town and you are bombarded by retail, restaurants, parking lots lit by high power LEDs akin to those found in football stadiums. Roads have become highways and highways freeways; drivers race along them, always in a rush to their mysterious destinations, from early in the morning to late at night. For only so much longer can this little marina hold; the tide will soon fall and urbanization will cast anchor. What reminds of small-town ways of life will soon wash away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I moved away seven years ago and at last found some peace. I could see the stars. I could breathe air free from the ocean&amp;rsquo;s salt, air that did not stifle or oppress. I could establish a new life without the weight and pain and baggage, without feeling like an outsider. I can grow. I can expand. I can sow my roots into a soil of possibility. I can carve out a world of my own, in which at last I feel I fit. And that feels like home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This piece was written in early 2017 for a composition class; specifically, one that started with geobiography writing, a call to consider the places we&amp;rsquo;ve lived and the places that have made us who we are. At the time, I had just moved out of my hometown and to where I still live today (I modified some of the wording here to reflect today). This is a little more bitter than I try to be today, but I think it still captures some of my feelings around home.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a New Years Resolution person; listening to a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/my-year-in-lists-2&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;My Year in Lists&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Los Campesinos! as a teen made me quite cynical about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; a very goal-oriented, reflective person. In late 2022, after years of gaining weight and developing some really negative patterns of self-talk around my body image, I decided to join a gym. Of course I&amp;rsquo;d like to see the number on the scale go down, but the main goal was just to get healthier and develop healthier habits. I started running, because that&amp;rsquo;s what I used to do (not well), and eventually convinced a friend to join with me. Together, we set the goal of running a 5K, and we did our first in May of 2023, in about 41 minutes (in our defense, it was an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; hilly course, but also progress, progress&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). We ran three more as the year went by; my most recent was November, where I finished in around 36 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not happy with the number on the scale, but I&amp;rsquo;m also trying not to focus on it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made a new gym buddy (adding, not replacing) who is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rigid in her visits, so I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that will help me continue to progress. I&amp;rsquo;m also doing a weekly volleyball rec league with some friends. And, always, I have the oblique goal to eat healthier.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2023 was also the year I bought a house with my partner. We&amp;rsquo;re still unpacking, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finally feel rooted in one place. We&amp;rsquo;ve lived in the same general area for the last seven years, but always in apartments that left me feeling transient. I hesitated to decorate because I worried about what would happen when we moved on to a new place (&lt;strong&gt;case in point:&lt;/strong&gt; I decided to break this habit and bought $500 in rugs last year; a month later, I was under contract on my house). Now that we&amp;rsquo;re in a more permanent spot, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel as much like a visitor.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally speaking of homes, I want to try to make this space my new home on the internet. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a strange relationship with the internet; I was on it near constantly as a teen. I ran a large fan forum for years, dabbled in web design and hosting, and posted regularly in a LiveJournal blog about the minutiae of high school life (no, I will not link to any of it; I&amp;rsquo;ve scrubbed a lot of it, and much of it has been lost to time, but there are traces).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like writing. I like journalling. I like blogging. I find them to be cathartic, to be outlets, to be mementos, and I want to commit to doing it all more often. This last year especially, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown negative in my feelings toward the internet and have been making efforts to decouple from  &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; social media. But I still yearn to connect, to put my voice and words out there. This feels like the healthy path: independent, small web. A space for me, by me, controlled by me.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the question has always been what to write about. I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by the calls of others (&lt;a href=&#34;https://library.xandra.cc/everyone-should-blog/&#34;&gt;EveryoneShouldBlog.txt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://robert.bearblog.dev/write-every-day/&#34;&gt;Write every day&lt;/a&gt;), and I&amp;rsquo;ve considered taking on a challenge like &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/a&gt; (if I do, consider this day one). But about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;? And are my thoughts really that interesting? Does it even matter if they are or aren&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see blogs often by folks who are engineers and programmers and developers, writing about their web projects or how they fix problems using tech. Selection bias exists; of course those are the folks writing on the web. I&amp;rsquo;m a middle school English teacher. I never feel like that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting thing to write about, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/on-teaching&#34;&gt;passionate as I am about it&lt;/a&gt;. Teacher blogs have always struck me as performative (and ugly), but given what a big piece of my life teaching is, perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s more there than I think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Internet privacy is important, so I&amp;rsquo;ve hesitated to blog about events of my personal life. Also, as a public space — albeit one I don&amp;rsquo;t openly advertise to friends — it feels weird and wrong to write about my personal relationships, like I&amp;rsquo;m mining the experiences I have with others for #content (I&amp;rsquo;m overthinking this) without the consent of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then I get caught in the idea that if I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; to write something, it needs to be fully-formed, long-form thoughts. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Being an English major really did a number on me.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; What matters is the writing, the thinking, the reflecting — and satisfying my urge to feel heard, to catalog my life in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: this is day one of this year. This is what I plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution one:&lt;/strong&gt; be kinder to and more patient with myself&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution two:&lt;/strong&gt; embrace fitness and develop healthier habits&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution three:&lt;/strong&gt; make a home that feels like mine (decorate)&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution four:&lt;/strong&gt; blog more; invest time in healthier spaces on the internet&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution five:&lt;/strong&gt; short posts are okay; not everything needs to be a manifesto (yes it does, but manifestos can be short, too)&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;A friend of mine is a big fan of Florence + the Machine. I confessed to only really knowing (but liking) her hits, &amp;ldquo;Dog Days&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Cosmic Love.&amp;rdquo; I asked which album she would recommend I listen to; she said &lt;em&gt;How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; (2015),&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I texted her about some of the songs on it. She asked if I was listening to the whole thing given the back to back messages; I said yes, and I started to consider &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I like to consume music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We live in a shuffled playlist and artist mix culture.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We collect our favorite tracks or let an algorithm serve us up suggestions of &amp;ldquo;you might like&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;this label paid for this to be fed to the masses.&amp;rdquo; I do it, too; much of my music listening is done passively, as a backdrop to other tasks that aren&amp;rsquo;t consuming my entire mental energy like driving or cleaning or unpacking (i.e. non-diegetic video game style background noise meant to go mostly unnoticed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TikTok is the ultimate bastardization of music listening&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as songs are reduced down to ten-second snippets replayed devoid of any context. Forget the entire &lt;em&gt;album&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re missing even just the &lt;em&gt;song&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have made a conscious effort recently to be more intentional in my listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intentional listening, to me, focuses on albums, not just on tracks. Especially when I&amp;rsquo;m listening to something new, I try to go through the entire album in order at least once (usually more). From there, I&amp;rsquo;ll select my favorites and put them on their requisite playlists, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s critical that we focus on the entire work &amp;ndash; not just selected pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Artists tell stories through albums. They captures moments in their lives, their artistic journeys. There are careful, deliberate choices in sequencing, relationships between tracks, and stunning transitions that we miss out on when we just play the hits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i had a good conversation with somebody about the struggle of the sequencing. This person told me, if every song has a purpose for it’s position them you can’t question it. I decided to give this tracklist a listen without just the musical ideas, but with exact purpose for each song. not just what i say or how it sounds, but how it makes me feel. i think my songs’ true meanings lie in the feeling they give me (or anybody listening.) so here is what happens in my album, and here is the final order. i’m not changing it. this is it. and this is why. Oh yeah, for a reason that may or may not be explained in this next novel you may decide to go and read after looking over this prologue. this whole album’s theme is birds. we will use that in every aspect. more on that later. first, enjoy… finally a method to the madness by yours truly: Malcolm James Xavier Samuel Meyers McCormick. p.s. i’m faded so some word choice may need retouching or fixing. hopefully i wrote what i was thinking correctly. hmmm, funny how difficult that is… shouldn’t we all be able to write exactly how we are feeling down on paper. Is the education system to blame? save that for my political angry rap album. anyways, that paragraph was pointless. i just wanted to create more reading for u cuz i am a horrible person. but actually read the next part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;— Mac Miller on sequencing &lt;em&gt;Watching Movies with the Sound Off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This shift is partly why I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into vinyl recently; it forces me to be intentional in my listening and to return to my favorite albums as entire works &amp;ndash; not just the &lt;em&gt;songs&lt;/em&gt; I love. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to limit myself to buying just my favorite albums on vinyl, which is perhaps as much an economic decision as it is a personal mandate. But take, for example, Sylvan Esso&amp;rsquo;s self-titled debut album. I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to it for years; &amp;ldquo;Coffee&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Hey Mami&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dreamy Bruises&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dress&amp;rdquo; feature on many of my playlists, but owning the record has forced me to sit down and listen through the whole thing in a way I haven&amp;rsquo;t since I first heard it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listening to records has also made music social for me. Sure, there are big Spotify playlists and end-of-year wraps shared out, but I&amp;rsquo;ve invited folks over to sit down and listen to some records &amp;ndash; to appreciate and talk about and enjoy the albums that have meant something to us and to share them with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intentional listening is looking at forests, not just the (proverbial) trees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Passing thoughts on the album: I like it! I appreciate the range of big, bombastic tracks like &amp;ldquo;What Kind of Man&amp;rdquo; with more pared back, quiet tracks like &amp;ldquo;St. Jude.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d also previously associated Florence mostly with the harp, and I was surprised and delighted by the brass in particular on this album (specifically the swells of &amp;ldquo;How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Which Witch&amp;rdquo;).&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with that &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s a wrong way to consume any art, really.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the risk of being old woman yells at cloud once again, this is maybe overly dramatic (but I do think TikTok is the root of many of society&amp;rsquo;s ills). I know TikTok has been good for the music industry in many ways. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also read accounts of artists feeling pressured by labels to create music with &amp;ldquo;TikTok moments&amp;rdquo; and I think that&amp;rsquo;s gross.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;The lives of many literary greats remain a relative mystery; literary critics and historians are often left to piece together details from letters, documentation, and, sometimes controversially, the author&amp;rsquo;s work read for repeated motifs. They then draw what conclusions they can about the authors&amp;rsquo; lives. One of the most prolific female poets in the English literary canon, Emily Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s life is preserved in letters and artifacts from her life. When examined as a body of work, Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s poetry reveals a pattern of focus on women&amp;rsquo;s interior lives and relationships that may be regarded as queer, especially with the added dimension of her close relationship with her sister-in-law. This essay examines a selection of her poems through a queer lens, highlighting the poems&amp;rsquo; relationships to female love and Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s life and arguing against established patterns of erasing Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s queer identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Critical representation of Dickinson paints her an immensely private, reclusive individual. Known in her Massachusetts home of Amherst as &amp;ldquo;the Myth,&amp;rdquo; Dickinson &amp;ldquo;lived a nun-like existence, wearing only white, seeing no one but her sister, writing poems that almost no one saw&amp;rdquo; (Nicholson). This suggests that the aforementioned canonical portrait of Dickinson is mostly accurate, but though she saw few in person, she had a rich inner existence, expressed in her many poems and letters. Indeed, both her poems and letters were directed to her &amp;ldquo;most trusted literary audience,&amp;rdquo; Sue Dickinson (née Gilbert) (Nell Smith 56). Dickinson shared &amp;ldquo;about 250 poems&amp;rdquo; with Gilbert, &amp;ldquo;by far the largest number&amp;rdquo; compared to Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s other family members and acquaintances (Franklin 3). While the particulars of their relationship are lost to time, Dickinson and Gilbert unarguably shared an intimate connection; many of Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s poems are directed, either explicitly or implicitly, to Gilbert. Despite this, &amp;ldquo;until recently most literary critics have refused to acknowledge her love for other women,&amp;rdquo; instead continuing to prop up the image of the maidenly recluse (Faderman 43). Twentieth century critics, acknowledging the romantic and erotic contents of Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s poems, embarked on a &amp;ldquo;quest for the identity of this &amp;lsquo;reclusive spinster&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; elusive (male) love,&amp;rdquo; though evidence shows &amp;ldquo;no significant heterosexual involvements until [Dickinson] was well into middle age&amp;rdquo; (Faderman 43). More recent literary criticism examines Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s poetry through a queer lens, but there is a long history of criticism going to &amp;ldquo;great lengths to explain away the content of same-sex love in her poems&amp;rdquo; (Faderman 45).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions of intimate female relationships are easy to identify within Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s vast collection of poems. In &amp;ldquo;Ourselves were wed one summer - dear,&amp;rdquo; Dickinson laments the end of a close relationship. The cause of separation is left obscure: Dickinson writes that &amp;ldquo;Our Futures different lay,&amp;rdquo; indicating that their lives lead them down diverging pathways, but also writes that the speaker&amp;rsquo;s object&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;little Lifetime failed&amp;rdquo; (Dickinson 9, 3). This adds a characteristically grim undercurrent to the poem, and may either be a physical or metaphorical death. The intimacy of the relationship is nonetheless underscored as Dickinson writes that she &amp;ldquo;wearied - too - of mine&amp;rdquo; after her object&amp;rsquo;s life ended (Dickinson 4). Dickinson therefore expresses that her life lacks meaning or value without her beloved. In the poem&amp;rsquo;s final stanza, Dickinson affirms that the poem describes a relationship between two women, writing that &amp;ldquo;we were Queens&amp;rdquo; (Dickinson 15) &amp;ndash; the speaker and her object are therefore definitively female.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; of the poem&amp;rsquo;s object seems to have occurred when she is &amp;ldquo;crowned in June&amp;rdquo; (Dickinson 16). Gilbert married Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s brother in July of 1856, the &amp;ldquo;crown[ing]&amp;rdquo; possibly referring to the couple&amp;rsquo;s engagement (Dickinson 16). Similarly, the &amp;ldquo;Bloom&amp;rdquo; of the object&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Garden&amp;rdquo; may be the birth of Gilbert&amp;rsquo;s first child in 1861, the blooming of plant-life being a common metaphor for reproduction (Dickinson 13). It was upon this marriage that &amp;ldquo;the relationship between Sue and Emily became stormy&amp;hellip; [and] Emily may have had a nervous breakdown,&amp;rdquo; a kind of metaphorical &amp;ldquo;Frost&amp;rdquo; in Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s life (Faderman 44; Dickinson 14).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this interpretation alone does not prove a lesbian relationship between Dickinson and Gilbert - only a close one - it upholds the existence of female relationships in Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s life and body of work. Other poems are far more explicit in their dedication to Gilbert, such as &amp;ldquo;You love me - you are sure,&amp;rdquo; which speaks to a &amp;ldquo;Dollie&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;You love me - you are sure&amp;rdquo; 6). An affectionate pet name, Dickinson referred to Gilbert as Dollie in her letters (Nell Smith 61). In the poem, Dickinson craves affirmation of Gilbert&amp;rsquo;s love, worrying that she will &amp;ldquo;wake - / Some grinning morn&amp;rdquo; to find the &amp;ldquo;Sunrise&amp;rdquo; (i.e. Gilbert) gone from her life (&amp;ldquo;You love me - you are sure&amp;rdquo; 3-5). In another poem, &amp;ldquo;To own a Susan of my own,&amp;rdquo; Dickinson writes that her love for Susan &amp;ldquo;is of itself a Bliss&amp;rdquo; and that she would &amp;ldquo;forfeit&amp;rdquo; anything to &amp;ldquo;Continue me in this,&amp;rdquo; that is, her relationship (&amp;ldquo;To own a Susan of my own&amp;rdquo; 3-4). Modern critics also point to distinct and repeated imagery in Dickson&amp;rsquo;s poetry, such as &amp;ldquo;jewels, gems, pearls, peas, berries, nuts, buds, crumbs, and beads,&amp;rdquo; which gloss as &amp;ldquo;clitoral&amp;hellip; [and] demonstrate an awareness of lesbian sexuality&amp;rdquo; (Faderman 45). It is neither difficult nor reaching to read the &amp;ldquo;Pink and Pulpy multitude&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Modesties enlarged&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Our little Kinsmen - after Rain&amp;rdquo; as such given these patterns and autobiographical considerations (&amp;ldquo;Our little Kinsmen - after Rain&amp;rdquo; 3, 11).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this intimate bond between Dickinson and Gilbert materialized as physical is impossible to know (and immaterial to the thesis), especially considering that the letters &amp;ldquo;written by Sue [to Emily] were destroyed at Emily&amp;rsquo;s death&amp;rdquo; by Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s brother Austin (and Gilbert&amp;rsquo;s husband), presumably in an effort to conceal the parameters of their relationship and avoid public knowledge of his wife&amp;rsquo;s queerness (Faderman 44). Dicksinon writes in her letters to Gilbert of a desire to &amp;ldquo;nestle close to your warm heart&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;carry me to you, and to bring you back to me, long enough to snatch one kiss&amp;rdquo; (Faderman 49). While these professions read as distinctively lesbian through a modern lens, they may simply be characteristic of the &amp;ldquo;sensual avowals of love&amp;rdquo; found in female relationships of the period (Smith-Rosenberg 168). These friendships existed along a &amp;ldquo;continuum or spectrum of affect gradations strongly affected by cultural norms and arrangements,&amp;rdquo; and they therefore defy modern classification (Smith-Rosenberg 180). It is similarly anachronistic and limiting for critics to &amp;ldquo;subdivide Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s love poetry into &amp;lsquo;homosexual&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;heterosexual&amp;rsquo; poems,&amp;rdquo; as it imposes a binary sexuality that did not exist during Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s time and which is opposed by modern queer theory (Henneberg 2). It is then perhaps most appropriate to label to sexuality, content, and eroticism in Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s body of work as queer (rather than &amp;lsquo;homosexual&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;lesbian&amp;rsquo;) in that it shifts the, at the time, historically androcentric narrative of poetry to focus instead on the relationships between women. This queerness manifests in Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s syntactical style as well, with her liberal use of hyphens and capitalization. She &amp;ldquo;break[s] traditional linguistic and  poetic forms&amp;rdquo; to reclaim them from patriarchal domination, creating something subversive in its distinct focus upon the interior lives of women and paving the way for future queer and lesbian poets like Adrienne Rich (Jeffs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is critical that the queer identities of canonical writers like Dickinson be discussed. Doing so affirms the long history of queer people, who existed before terms like &amp;ldquo;homosexual,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;bisexual,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lesbian.&amp;rdquo; It also adds dimension to the examination and interpretation of their work, elevating natural imagery and symbols in Dickinson&amp;rsquo;s work to indicative of her interior life, love, and relations. These considerations must be preserved in the same way that we preserve other artifacts from author&amp;rsquo;s lives; they offer readers a glimpse into their lives, values, and identities and help readers understand who they were and what they wrote about. These queer readings may, at times, seem to fly in the face of current literary discourse, but it is critical that we not allow these facts of author&amp;rsquo;s identifies to be erased; to do so would be a disservice to the author and to queer history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;works-cited&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#works-cited&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Works Cited&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickinson, Emily. &amp;ldquo;Our little Kinsmen - after&#xA;Rain.&amp;rdquo; 1865.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;—. &amp;ldquo;Ourselves were wed one summer - dear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;1863.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;—. &amp;ldquo;To own a Susan of my own.&amp;rdquo; 1877.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;—. &amp;ldquo;You love me - you are sure.&amp;rdquo; 1861.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Faderman, Lillian. &amp;ldquo;Emily Dickinson.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Chloe&#xA;Plus Olivia: An Anthology of Lesbian Literature from the Seventeenth Century to&#xA;the Present&lt;/em&gt;.

        &lt;p&gt;In the beginning of Chapter VIII in the third section of &lt;em&gt;To the Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;, pages 186-187, Virginia Woolf&amp;rsquo;s unique approach to perspective and introspection create a subjective presentation of reality and relationships, supported by extended metaphors of fluidity and stillness. On a boat trip mandated by Mr. Ramsay to the titular lighthouse, Cam and James anatomize and unfold their feelings towards their father. Cam evolves as the boat moves across the sea while James&amp;rsquo;s unflinching rage and violence towards the patriarch repeat in this section as the sailboat halts and space contracts to exacerbate his indignation. Woolf thus frames and explores the figure of Mr. Ramsay and the nominal motif of a journey through individual introspection and excurses. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The selection picks up directly from the end of Chapter IV, shifting away from an interlude wherein Lily Briscoe works on her painting and contemplates her own relationships to both Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, the former present in the scene with Cam and James, the latter casting a long shadow over it &amp;ndash; James&amp;rsquo;s hatred of Mr. Ramsay was first introduced in an Oedipal fashion in the novel&amp;rsquo;s very first chapter, where James sees Mr. Ramsay as basking in &amp;ldquo;the pleasure of disillusioning his son&amp;hellip; [and] ridicul[ing] his wife,&amp;rdquo; and James perceives his mother as &amp;ldquo;ten times better in every way than&amp;rdquo; her husband (Woolf 8). Woolf seemingly disregards flow and a coherent progression of events by bisecting the boat journey with Lily&amp;rsquo;s artistic journey; her prose instead acts more as combined snapshots from various perspectives about fraught, inscrutable figures like Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay. The boat trip is merely a device through which Woolf can open &amp;ldquo;the picture into the depths of consciousness,&amp;rdquo; i.e. James and Cam&amp;rsquo;s internal reflections about their father (Auerbach 540).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While Cam and James were at first united in their mission to &amp;ldquo;fight tyranny to the death&amp;rdquo; during the trip to the lighthouse, tyranny being Mr. Ramsay, Cam softens on her father toward the end of Chapter IV (Woolf 167). It is no accident, then, that Chapter VIII opens with the boat still in motion and from Cam&amp;rsquo;s perspective &amp;ndash; the movement of the boat frames the characters&amp;rsquo; parenthetical thoughts. Cam contemplates the &amp;ldquo;green swirls and&amp;hellip; patterns&amp;rdquo; made by her hand in the water and imagines an &amp;ldquo;underworld of waters&amp;rdquo; where &amp;ldquo;in the green light a change came over one&amp;rsquo;s entire mind&amp;rdquo; (Woolf 186). These images of fluidity and change reflect the previous excurses into Cam&amp;rsquo;s subjective reality &amp;ndash; her thawing resistance to her father. However, when the wind suddenly calms and the boat stops moving, James stews in the same thoughts that have gripped him throughout the novel (his antipathy for his father), a kind of stillness of thought and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though the group&amp;rsquo;s journey halts for what amounts to little time, James&amp;rsquo;s ruminations toward his father &amp;ldquo;take up far more time in the narration than the whole scene could possibly have lasted&amp;rdquo; (Auerbach 529). For James, &amp;ldquo;everything in the whole world seemed to stand still,&amp;rdquo; and thus the progression of time and action halts to give way to his internal reflections and thought (Woolf 186). While time expands to allow for this excurses into James&amp;rsquo;s internal realities, space contracts in the &amp;ldquo;horrid calm&amp;rdquo; and he must feel the &amp;ldquo;presence&amp;rdquo; of his companions, the most odious of which is his father (Woolf 186). James spots an attitude in each of Mr. Ramsay&amp;rsquo;s page turns, which are &amp;ldquo;now assertively, now commandingly; now with the intention of making people pity him,&amp;rdquo; and of course that may be the case (Woolf 186-87). However, it is far more likely that James simply perceives these attitudes &amp;ndash; that they are a manifestation of his resentment &amp;ndash; and Mr. Ramsay is simply reading a book to pass the time. The passage ends with James resolving that, should his father make a quip about the boat having stopped, that he &amp;ldquo;shall take a knife and strike to the heart&amp;rdquo; (Woolf 187). James&amp;rsquo;s dedication to his compact with his sister, and his internal reality of Mr. Ramsay, thus remains constant, as does his perception of the boat ride as an act of despotism, rather than, as Cam as begun to see it, an attempt by Mr. Ramsay to reconcile the past by fulfilling a desire of the deceased Mrs. Ramsay (to go to the lighthouse) and to grow closer to his children.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What should the reader make, then, of the boat ride and, by extension, Mr. Ramsay? Woolf offers no clear conclusion, with Cam and James at first agreeing and later diverging on both subjects through their individual &amp;ldquo;way[s] of looking at reality&amp;rdquo; (Auerbach 536). As Auerbach writes in an analysis of another passage from the novel, &amp;ldquo;we are given not merely one person whose consciousness&amp;hellip; is rendered, but many persons&amp;rdquo; and that the reader is thus &amp;ldquo;confronted with an endeavor to investigate an objective reality&amp;rdquo; (Auerbach 536). That objective reality &amp;ndash; the boat ride and Mr. Ramsay&amp;rsquo;s character &amp;ndash; is not &amp;ldquo;restrained by a purpose nor directed by a specific subject of thought,&amp;rdquo; instead synthesized from multiple and, at times, competing perspectives. The &amp;ldquo;exterior events,&amp;rdquo; like the boat moving and halting and then moving again &amp;ldquo;have actually lost their hegemony,&amp;rdquo; instead serving to release &amp;ldquo;the much more significant inner process&amp;rdquo; (Auerbach 538).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Woolf thus builds in this section additional nuance to the trip to the lighthouse and the fraught character of Mr. Ramsay. One could easily have written the events of the chapter as, &amp;ldquo;the sailboat briefly hits a calm and stops; the wind soon picks up again and James, Mr. Ramsay, Cam, et al. continue their journey to the lighthouse.&amp;rdquo; But the &amp;ldquo;common focus&amp;rdquo; of the excurses &amp;ndash; exploring the children&amp;rsquo;s relationships to their father; Mr. Ramsay as a whole, and the meaning of the journey &amp;ndash; instead holds the weight and meaning of this side of the third and final section of the novel (Auerbach 539). Woolf offers no explicit conclusion or objective reality &amp;ndash; is Mr. Ramsay truly a tyrant, or not? &amp;ndash; an impartial narrative voice being absent from the novel, but the reader nonetheless grows closer toward an understanding of characters and events in the novel through her experimentation with perspective and presentation of introspection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;works-cited&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#works-cited&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Works Cited&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auerbach, Erich, and Willard  R.

Specifically, this was written for an Approaches to Literature course in March of 2017. The assignment was to conduct an Auerbachian close reading analysis of a section from &lt;em&gt;To the Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;. I recall loathing this class and most of the texts (with the exception of &lt;em&gt;To the Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;, likely because I was already a fan of Woolf at the time and because I can connect to the whole resenting your dad deal). I found this paper incredibly challenging to write, as Woolf and Auerbach do not exactly exude simplicity, but I&amp;rsquo;m still proud of the end result years on.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

There&amp;rsquo;s been lots of chatter, and I loved &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Barbie&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t hit for me; too much Ken (to be the hundredth person to whine about it) and the ending felt unearned and thematically confused. This was more of an homage to &lt;em&gt;Barbie&lt;/em&gt; as a product than it was an homage to womanhood, but it pretended to be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;games&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#games&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Games&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vampire Survivors&lt;/em&gt; - I originally played &lt;em&gt;Vampire Survivors&lt;/em&gt; for my video game podcast, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitchandplay.org&#34;&gt;Pitch &amp;amp; Play&lt;/a&gt; (on hiatus but will come back!); my friend and co-host Ross recommended it to me. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I got into it given that I don&amp;rsquo;t really have nostalgia for this sort of game, but I played several hours of it and then became distracted by life. While moving this month, I was without internet for quite a while and had not hooked up my consoles (or my PC, still). To kill some time while my body recovered from lifting boxes and scrubbing surfaces, I downloaded &lt;em&gt;Vampire Survivors&lt;/em&gt; onto my phone and went deep into it. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic game that I&amp;rsquo;ll come to associate with my early days in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;books&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#books&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Books&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk Two Moons&lt;/em&gt; by Sharon Creech - I read this book originally as a child in the fifth grade. I remember loving it but little else. I have been looking for a text to add to my curriculum and wanted to try &lt;em&gt;Walk Two Moons&lt;/em&gt; out. I enjoyed reading it and was surprised by how much of it came back to me even though I am (nearly) twenty years out from reading it the first time. I do think the Native American set dressing might be problematic given that the author is not, by any account I&amp;rsquo;ve read, actually Native; the plot is also predictable, but perhaps that is because I&amp;rsquo;m an adult reading a book written for children and because I&amp;rsquo;ve read it before. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s the book I&amp;rsquo;m looking for, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;This September marks the start of my fourth year teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was always interested in teaching; my grandparents had an unfinished basement that, for some reason, had a little chalkboard and table. My siblings and I would play school down there, and I loved to play the role of teacher &amp;ndash; despite being considerably younger than them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I loved school, too. I loved most every subject (especially grammar &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m one of the few children who absolutely rejoiced when asked to take out my grammar workbook) and was, at the risk of conceit, &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at academics. I also read voraciously in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in the seventh grade, I became somewhat disillusioned with English class. It entertains my students when I tell them that I absolutely hated seventh grade English, and I attribute this largely to my teacher. I don&amp;rsquo;t think she was incompetent, but she was uninspired in her approach. The texts we read were dreadful (&lt;em&gt;The Cay&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle&lt;/em&gt;, I am convinced, will turn any child against the field of English literature wholesale), which I know may have been beyond her control, and it was one of the first times in my schooling that I struggled to grasp concepts, namely sentence types and who/whom.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eighth grade rolled around, and I had a teacher I felt I &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt; with in some way; I saw her as a role model and, more importantly, she encouraged me to use my voice, to share my ideas. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been opinionated (a &amp;ldquo;smartass,&amp;rdquo; in the words of one of my elementary school teachers), and those opinions always manifested around our class texts, but I never felt that I was in an open, collaborative environment that encouraged me to share those opinions. I started slow; she was a new teacher, and she would try to lead class discussions and be met with blank stares (a symptom of middle school more so than her teaching, I think). I was bored of the silence and chose, at last, to tell her that I thought &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; was boring tripe and that Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on simple, straightforward prose followed from the hyper-masculine assumption that literature should not be beautiful and artful, which is stupid.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She smiled and challenged me on some of this, but the message was received: it was &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; encouraged, even &amp;ndash; to not like the books teachers presented me with, and I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; voice my opinions! She also was the first teacher to take us deeper into a text as we dove into the Christian allegory of the story, so that even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t personally &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; reading the book, I could at least respect some elements of it.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I had held onto my interest in teaching &amp;ndash; though, being thirteen, I had a lot more teenage concerns on my mind than what I wanted to do when I &amp;ldquo;grew up&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; but it gained focus that year. I thought, &lt;em&gt;maybe &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is what I want to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High school proceeded and I had some ups and downs in my freshman and sophomore English courses.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I also started taking technology courses now that I was actually offered electives. I was, and still am, a bona fide computer nerd; most of my teenage years were spent online&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I just loved &lt;em&gt;tinkering&lt;/em&gt;. I had the privilege of going to a bougie high school that offered tech classes sponsored by Cisco, which went through basic computer maintenance to fundamentals of computer networks (I learned to subnet, by hand) all the way to programming corporate routers. My teacher of those courses encouraged me, told me I had a natural ability with the technology (maybe true, but again, computer nerd &amp;ndash; this was the sort of thing I was already doing in my free time, to an extent) and that I could have a lucrative career in it straight out of high school. He also made clear that my gender would benefit me; companies would hire me to meet diversity goals. I could reasonably expect to make in the high five-figures at an entry level if I used some of the connections he offered me.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the end of high school started to loom, I was conflicted: I was passionate about both paths and could see myself in either. I had another English teacher my junior year who again connected me to the subject and stood to me as a window into what my future could be &amp;ndash; but I also knew the teaching market was, at the time, awful for English teachers. And even if I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; find a job, I could only dream of making the salary that technology offered. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the memory of how it felt to be in eighth grade, and then eleventh grade, and have a teacher who lit me up: who showed me how complex and debatable and transformative literature could be, who listened patiently as I railed against authors and texts they no doubt loved, who challenged me to find reasoning and evidence and integrate theory with my (sometimes borderline edgelord) critiques, who said to me, perhaps not in these words but in their practice, &amp;ldquo;You have a voice and that voice &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At last during senior year, I felt I had to commit. I went to my English teacher from the previous year and asked her how she chose teaching. I won&amp;rsquo;t share the details of her story &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s her story to tell &amp;ndash; but she described being in a very similar situation as me: torn between what seemed &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; and what she was &lt;em&gt;passionate&lt;/em&gt; about. She chose the passion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reflecting on all of this because I have been on summer break for the last month and a half now, and while it has been much needed relaxation and recuperation (&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/stages-of-moving/&#34;&gt;and moving&lt;/a&gt;), at my department curriculum planning day today, I felt like myself again. A coworker brought up our staff mega millions pool, and I confess that I bought in often because I&amp;rsquo;d feel like a fool if a bunch of my coworkers won millions and I was still out here teaching. She said she would keep teaching; another coworker agreed; and I did too. We worked all day, and even when I got home, I wanted to start creating and revising curriculum, setting up my learning management system, getting ready for the start of the year.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love teaching. I feel lucky to have coworkers who love it like I do. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to remember all of this on the days when I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; feel surrounded by coworkers who share my passions, on the days when the career is hard to love. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I still would like to be paid more, please.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this was more control freak tendencies than love for teaching, but then, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure teaching and being a control freak are ontologically separate.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big proponent of teaching grammar in context and regularly. That was not the approach that this teacher took; she spent a handful of isolated days making us do worksheets on comma splices and making us distinguish between who and whom without helping us understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things worked as they do &amp;ndash; and then tested us on it at the end of the week and expected it to just be seared within our memories months later despite not mentioning it ever again.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not in these words exactly, but I was getting there.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not read &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, or really any Hemingway, since then, so I do not necessarily think these opinions hold up. But then, it really is a boring book.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two stories I like to tell about how spite inspired me to become a teacher, and one occurred in my 10th grade English class. Another story for another post, I think; it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; here.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also another story for another time, but one I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready or willing to tell.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t resent his pointing this out, for two reasons: one, it was true, and probably still is; two, he never presented it in a way that made me uncomfortable. He was matter-of-fact about it &amp;ndash; it was an advantage I had that I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; behoove myself of, but he also was willing to discuss the challenges I would face, too, as a woman in a male-dominated field.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead I chose to write this, which is probably the healthier option.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I recently listened to an episode of &lt;em&gt;Never Been a Better Podcast&lt;/em&gt; in which Austin Walker, referencing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/v21/status/1490297801569353729&#34;&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by @v21, posited that we are moving into a new era of the internet where content is generated by machines rather than people; where once the internet was used by people to access large bodies of information and to connect with &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people, we now use it to connect with machines that regurgitate photocopies of photocopies of information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of the internet from a database of (somewhat) reliable information into a long game of telephone is troubling; as they discuss on that same podcast, no video game walkthrough site that ranks at the top of Google today is ever more reliable than the GameFAQs txt files filled with ASCII art that were painstakingly written by fourteen year olds, peer reviewed, and continuously revised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is all true, and it is worth discussing and writing about. But I am thinking about the point of connection. I often feel that we have lost the human connection found on the internet of old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how old I was exactly when I &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; the internet. I can remember when we got a computer. I was four or five years old, which would have been 1998 or 1999; my dad bought a PC because he was in college at the time, and our musty basement became its home. I spent time playing &lt;em&gt;Gus Goes to Cyberopolis&lt;/em&gt; and various &lt;em&gt;Reader Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; titles. My dad would go on to drop out of college, and when my parents split up a few years later, the PC remained and eventually made its way up to the main house. I continued with my edutainment games and graduated to doodling on MS Paint and experimenting with fonts in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. (This, I have realized, was my first hit of the rich world of font obsession, and I have maintained that sickness into adulthood; I also started to play a lot of Solitaire, which I still do today, too.) The extent of my forays into the internet were, however, when my siblings and I browbeat my mother into allowing us to start a Neopets account and when we would watch over my older cousin&amp;rsquo;s shoulder as she browsed FunnyJunk (a proto-meme site), Albino Black Sheep, and Bored.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My experiences with Neopets were short lived because I was too young and too stupid to figure out how to make money, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feed my Neopets and had to get food from the soup kitchens. It felt bleak; how I missed the games on Neopets, I do not know, but suffice to say that this capitalism simulator was not the stuff of thrills for elementary schoolers. The websites my cousin would browse felt a bit too risqué for me, so after a stint where I would play &lt;em&gt;Cadet Kelly&lt;/em&gt; games on the Disney website, I eventually landed on one of the only websites I knew to be safe, trustworthy, and mom-approved: eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mother has been an active eBay user since 1998. Most afternoons when she was home from work, she would sit at her desk and browse eBay, eventually building a decent side-income buying and selling curtains on there. eBay was a fixture in our household, and so it became my first step into online fandom. I would spend hours searching my favorite video game and book series on eBay and browse the troves of merchandise for purchase. Somewhere in my brain, I realized that there were other people out there who loved the same things as me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That opened the floodgates. Soon I was browsing Angelfire and Geocities fanpages, reading fanfiction, and joining message boards. I was teaching myself HTML and CSS to create personal and fan websites on Freewebs. All of this was in pursuit of connecting with other (by this point) pre-teens and teens (and some grown adults) who shared my passions. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find those same connections at school, so I sought, and found, them online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This so far is a rather rosy view of the early web and my time on it. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to say that all of my interactions online were positive, and my relationship with the internet as the years went on became deeply unhealthy. I spent most of my childhood on the internet and did a lot of stupid shit on it. But the best parts of it were feeling like I was part of something &amp;ndash; a community &amp;ndash; and like I &lt;em&gt;mattered&lt;/em&gt; within it &amp;ndash; something that I was not finding in my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; life. (I would often decry the folks who drew a line between their online lives and &amp;ldquo;irl&amp;rdquo; because, to me, the internet &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; my life.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To keep those rose-colored glasses on for a few more minutes, though, I miss that today. I miss following the webrings and reading the webmaster&amp;rsquo;s about page. I miss searching up my rare pair on Fanfiction.net and finding one (very dedicated) user churning out fics. I miss reading guestbooks and comment sections (that aren&amp;rsquo;t filled with the most hateful tripe you can imagine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss feeling like the internet was something bigger than me but that I was a part of it. I miss feeling like my voice mattered on it. I miss feeling like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t just shouting into the void; people were calling back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is human connection to be found online today. Many, many folks use social media to keep up with faraway friends and family (I do, too); there are thriving Discord servers centered around fandoms and other niche internets&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; and there are amazing efforts out there like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt; that seek to reclaim some of the experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve described. It all just feels too &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. I took a broad step back from my once rather public (but thankfully detached from my &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; self, by which I mean my name and my face) internet persona and intentionally broke a lot of the connections I had, choosing instead to focus on college and my career and my in-person relationships. I am happier and in a better place mentally for it. But I have still, over the years, remained on social media, tried to put my voice out there in small ways (blogging and podcasting, mostly). I often question whether those attempts are a relapse, chasing the hollow highs I once felt from (very minor and within a very niche circle) internet notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m choosing instead to interpret the urge as chasing after the internet that once felt useful and exciting and joyful to me rather than the one I see today, which feels like a proverbial yoke around society&amp;rsquo;s neck. I want to reclaim control of the time I spend online and the content that I choose to put onto it &amp;ndash; rather than feed the obsessive spirals I once fell into, which have grown more and more insidious as they have corporatized and monetized and designed algorithms that provide steady streams of dopamine. I want to focus on the small: the independently run, the hyper-focused, the demonetized. The shit made by folks who are, like me, passionate and a little bored and who have a little more time than good sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think my failed attempts at blogging in the past have always come back to feeling like I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything useful or productive to say. I was focused on the &lt;em&gt;void&lt;/em&gt; and not on the &lt;em&gt;shouting&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps sometimes we need to shout to just to shout, to shout just to hear &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, to shout just to know that we are alive and have a voice that we can use. Otherwise, we learn to feel voiceless and alienated and disconnected, and we feed the content machines that are delivered to us rather than find our own internal power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time in human history wherein we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; shout and be heard by millions of people across the globe with the push of a few buttons. The long-dead writers and artists I love did not have that luxury, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop them from shouting. I&amp;rsquo;m often caught in the anxiety that someone has already said what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at, probably in a more witty or articulate manner. Maybe or maybe not. That&amp;rsquo;s not what matters. Quiet is passive. Quiet is easy. Time to break the silence and use my voice. Connections will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have my issues with how communities have moved to a closed, non-indexable platform like Discord rather than open spaces like forums, but perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s a post for another day.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;Part of my resolution to blog more is to start a media consumption log for the year where I record what I’m reading, watching, and listening to. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it monthly; expect a finalized list on the last day of each month (possibly backdated).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;movies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#movies&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Movies&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fast and the Furious&lt;/em&gt; - a rewatch of a movie I watched way too much as a child and therefore have an unreasonable fondness and attachment towards. The dialogue in this movie is positively absurd (“I like the tuna here,&amp;quot; “Welcome to Race Wars”), the homoerotic undertones bordering on overtones, and everyone in this movie (except Vince but including Jesse) is blisteringly hot. I was edified by the friend I had watched the film (not movie) with, who had never seen it, as she remarked at the end, “I get it now.” I could have done without the oil scene, however.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Fast 2 Furious&lt;/em&gt; – well, now it’s a marathon. &lt;em&gt;2 Fast 2 Furious&lt;/em&gt; has, historically and controversially, been both my favorite sequel naming schema and overall entry in the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; saga. I love the first, but this movie embraces the stupidity and over-the-top action that would go on to define the series. It manages to succeed without Vin Diesel (or any of the “family,” except for Brian, though it introduces future members) and contains some iconic (to me) scenes (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpwl45hUQfc&amp;amp;pp=ygUMZWplY3RvIHNlYXRv&#34;&gt;Ejecto seato&lt;/a&gt; and everything involving Suki). I smile constantly while watching this movie. I love it and I think it loves me back. Except for the rat scene. I could do without the rat scene.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&lt;/em&gt; – I would like to say that I came to my second viewing of this movie with an open mind (I didn’t), hoping to understand the cultural revisionism of some &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; fans who claim that this is actually one of the best in the series (it isn’t). Somehow this movie makes drifting boring. Han is the only interesting character. There’s a character who everyone refers to as “DK” (short for “Drift King”) throughout the film and yet he is as bland and forgettable as the rest. Sean is the worst, and it is a miracle the series managed to rebound from this low. &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Drift&lt;/em&gt; is the ugly step-cousin of the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; series. At least the theme song slaps.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; – viewed right after &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Drift&lt;/em&gt; to cleanse my palate and remind me what a good movie feels like. The opening scene immediately reminds one of the highs of the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; saga, and while the rest of the movie is far from the best, it is miles ahead of &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Drift&lt;/em&gt;, if only because it reunites the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; family and sets the pieces in place for the highs of the series to come.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Five&lt;/em&gt; – a truly thrilling movie start to finish and perhaps the best of the series. Everything about this movie is fun — no rat or oil scenes to be found. Instead, just action sequences that constantly raise the stakes and delight — and, of course, the reunion of the family (sans-Letty).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 6&lt;/em&gt; – a middling sequel to the high point of the &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; series and my last rewatch; from here on out, it is all new to me. This one is watchable and certainly ranks as one of the better &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; movies. It chases the ragtag quality that the family had in the last movie but doesn’t hit the same notes. The movie shines when it focuses on Dom and Letty’s relationship, and the bridge scene is one of the best stupid stunts in the series.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Furious 7&lt;/em&gt; – a mostly forgettable setup and plot offset by some truly ridiculous moments that make the film, overall, enjoyable. This was a classy send-off for Paul Walker that I’m sure was emotional in the moment but is today soured by him being kind of a creep. I wish to wed the individual who came up with the Rock breaking his cast off and entering the action, the skyscraper scene, Dom running over Shaw&amp;rsquo;s car, and, most of all, the rwrench fight. I say individual because I like to believe there is a single person responsible for this lunacy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;tv&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#tv&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        TV&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt;, season one – interesting in broad strokes, but I found it deeply problematic on an episode-to-episode basis. This felt like a movie trilogy that decided to be a television show, and it does not work as either. It may not be fair for me to levy my frustrations with cinematic universes against &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; obsession notwithstanding), but I spent much of my time with the show questioning its necessity (even as a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; lover and a particular fan of &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;). Much of &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt; felt like it was undercutting &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; and Jyn’s significance to the Alliance. &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt; has compelling ideas and is competently shot and acted, with occasionally strong moments every few episodes, but it ultimately didn’t win me over. I will give a second season a try, but &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt; disappointed me, especially given the high expectations others’ reactions gave me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;music&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#music&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Music&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;22, a Million&lt;/em&gt;, Bon Iver – I do not have much experience with Bon Iver outside of “Skinny Love” (which is fine), but I vaguely recall my sister playing me a song, “10 d E A T h b R E a s T ⚄ ⚄”, from_ 22, a Million_ around when it came out. Sparked by a recent conversation with her and stumbling across an article that I now cannot find about some of the controversy around the album’s release, I’ve been listening to it a fair amount. It’s an abstract, exciting album; none of the songs particularly stand out to me as Playlist Material, but that is perhaps the intention of the album: it is to be listened to in sittings, full through, not in the vacuum we have become accustomed to of random shuffles and algorithmic picks. I admire any artist that experiments with their releases and does not rest on the laurels of their hits, so initial impressions are strong, but I get the sense that this is an album that begs for the listener to reflect and decode.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never Hungover Again&lt;/em&gt;, Joyce Manor – discovered through a Front Bottoms shuffle with “Heart Tattoo,” which is a highlight of the album for me. Never Hungover Again is a breezy listen: ten tracks, most falling between one and two minutes. I found the first five tracks mostly discardable, but the second half was much stronger with the aforementioned “Heart Tattoo,” “In the Army Now,” and “Catalina Fight Song.” Emo revival works best for me in The Front Bottoms style: catchy riffs and earnest lyrics that read like teenage LiveJournal entries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;games&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#games&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Games&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; - I played a metric ton of &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; and emerged with feelings ranging from ambivalent to frustrated. There was so much I loved about it and so much that just never came together (or actively frustrated me). &lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom,&lt;/em&gt; however, has brought me nothing but joy; it corrects every complaint I had with &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; and improves upon it wholesale. I&amp;rsquo;m far from done with the game &amp;ndash; I think I will be playing it for some time &amp;ndash; but so far, it is remarkable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza&lt;/em&gt; - played with friends but I had the eerie suspicion I&amp;rsquo;ve played it before but cannot place it. Fine in a group but mostly forgettable. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t seek it out again.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/em&gt; - my love, my liege. &lt;em&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/em&gt; is a bastion in our household. I love it every time I play, except when I lose, which is often.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Busy Bistro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://magicpuzzlecompany.com/&#34;&gt;Magic Puzzle Company&lt;/a&gt; - a friend spotted this on Tik Tok and invited me over to work on it with her. Reader, I was there until three in the morning. A fantastic puzzle with charming art, done in good company.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Well, I have another blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.land&#34;&gt;cassie.land&lt;/a&gt;, the latest (as of writing this) web project that I&amp;rsquo;ve started and may promptly abandon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: These past few months have shown me the impermanence of online platforms. I have quit reddit with the third-party API shutdowns, and while I am probably better off for it, it does feel like losing one of the bastions of the internet I once knew. I regret to inform that I am officially an old person on the internet; I yearn for the days of hyper-specific Geocities pages with incredibly useful information written by a thirteen year old screaming into the void (and for the days where our search engines actually directed us to that information rather than some circuitous tripe written by AI that packs in every SEO keyword without actually saying anything).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally, this was written on my old WordPress blog, a site I&amp;rsquo;ve had up for almost ten years now (and which I will not link, because &lt;em&gt;ten years&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided fully what I want to do with it). I&amp;rsquo;ve been using WordPress on and off for random projects for going on fifteen years now, and while it&amp;rsquo;s comfortable and flexible and I know it well, I yearn for something different. Something lighter. Something new. &lt;del&gt;Enter Grav, which I&amp;rsquo;ve now spent the night learning.&lt;/del&gt; Enter Hugo, which I switched to kind of on a whim — Grav is cool, but it felt a little too easy. I&amp;rsquo;m a masochist, I guess; I miss code. Grav felt like a shortcut and like more bloat than I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so I hope to make this a resolution to blog more, openly, about me. I have thoughts I like to share and a desire to catalogue the things I am interested in, and it just doesn’t seem viable any more to do so on any online platforms that I don’t own. I feel, in a sense, “homeless” on the internet, and I think it is time we make those homes on ground that won’t be pulled out from under us by soulless corporations and CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not fully sure what this will end up being, but thanks for reading and joining me on the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;This past year has emphasized to me the impermanence of online platforms. I have quit reddit with the third-party API shutdowns, and while I am probably better off for it, it does feel like losing one of the bastions of the internet I once knew. I regret to inform that I am officially an old person on the internet; I yearn for the days of hyper-specific Geocities pages with incredibly useful information written by a thirteen year old screaming into the void (and for the days where our search engines actually directed us to that information rather than some circuitous tripe written by AI that packs in every SEO keyword without actually saying anything).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have channeled these ruminations into redesigning my blog for the eight hundredth time, but this time, I am also resolving to use it more. I have thoughts I like to share and a desire to catalogue the things I am interested in, and it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem viable any more to do so on any online platforms that I don&amp;rsquo;t own. I feel, in a sense, &amp;ldquo;homeless&amp;rdquo; on the internet, and I think it is time we make those homes on ground that won&amp;rsquo;t be pulled out from under us with the passing whimsy of a manchild CEO. (In case there is any ambiguity, I am indeed referring to Elon Musk and Steve Huffman.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will I follow through on that promise? We&amp;rsquo;ll see. In the past, I have been caught up in the idea that this blog should be for long-form posts with deep thinking and planning. Maybe that should still be true, but I also want to embrace the passing whimsy and interests that occupy my time. Thanks for reading and joining me on the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;It feels like most of my blog posts end up being about music. I’d like to pretend that this post is a piece of an annual tradition in which I review and analyze my listening patterns from the past year, but truth be told, I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/heres-what-i-was-listening-to-in-2015/&#34;&gt;only done this once before, in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/my-top-ten-albums-from-the-2010s/&#34;&gt;kind of early in 2020, when I reviewed my favorite albums from the last ten years&lt;/a&gt;. Truth is, I’d like this to be a tradition, a habit I develop, but I’ve had about as much success with that as I have with my resolution to exercise more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to explain that 2020 has been a unique year. If I put on my English major bullshitting hat, I can maybe postulate that I write about music in the years that music was especially important to me. In 2015, music was the backdrop of my first (and current) serious, long-term relationship. I exchanged stolen moments and mix CDs, so the music I was listening to at that time became a sense-memory trigger, a nostalgic sound that brought me back to first kisses and early butterflies. And when I wrote about my favorite albums released from 2010 to 2019, I was making sense of my teenage years — the music that comforted me, changed me, channeled me. It only seems natural then to write about the music in this weird, mixed up year, because quarantine has made a process that’s usually internal for me — listening to and thinking about music — more weighty, more important. I’ve had more time to focus on media like music because there’s not much else to do. I’m spending more time alone in front of my computer than any person normally should. My screen time (which means music time) this past year has probably rivalled the internet addiction of my teen years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve also used these posts to discuss &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I listen to music in some way. Sparked by the shutdown of Google Play Music, which was my preferred way to sync my massive music library to my phone, I moved over to Plex and the Plexamp mobile app. It thankfully offers excellent last.fm support, so I continued scrobbling there, but I didn’t set it up until a few weeks into my Plex journey — so a lot of play counts are probably lower than they should be. Still, the numbers paint an accurate picture, even if the exact details are muddy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That all said, let’s get to the wheat and away from the chaff. Here’s the list of music I was listening to in 2020 that wasn’t necessarily released in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;mac-miller-1469-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#mac-miller-1469-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Mac Miller (1469 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Movin&amp;rsquo; so fast the clock look slow&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Water my seeds &amp;rsquo;til the flowers grow&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love so much that my heart get broke&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how the normal shit go&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Mac Miller, &amp;ldquo;Wings&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/my-top-ten-albums-from-the-2010s/#swimming&#34;&gt;wrote about &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, I was cautious. I knew it was an important album and that it was a gateway for me. I knew there were some phenomenal tracks and impressive flows. A year later, I’m much more effusive in my praise (and critical of the songs I listed as the best — I did not appreciate “Wings” or “Dunno” as they deserve). I’ve moved from my “mac miller songs i think i like but idk” playlist to one titled “i need to listen to something other than mac miller,” partly at my boyfriend’s request, because I truly didn’t listen to much other than Easy Mac with the cheesy raps this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of Mac Miller’s music is the variation in his discography and skillset. His abstract jazz EP &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;, for example, is bookended by the experimental, depressive &lt;em&gt;Macadelic&lt;/em&gt;, released eight months prior, and &lt;em&gt;Watching Movies with the Sound Off&lt;/em&gt;, which is perhaps his strongest rap album released (rivaled perhaps by &lt;em&gt;GO:OD AM&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s a conversation for folks who know way more about rap than me to debate). It’s unfortunate that Mac’s career lasted as little time as it did, cut short by his death in 2018, but he produced an incredible amount in that time — and much of it has yet to see the light of day. There are days I’m looking for early career Mac, the &lt;em&gt;Blue Slide Park&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Best Day Ever&lt;/em&gt; era, when the world was before him and he was ready (and excited to) conquer it; there are days when the smooth romanticism of &lt;em&gt;Circles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Divine Feminine&lt;/em&gt; are appealing; and there are days when I need the emotional catharsis of his more complicated releases, like &lt;em&gt;Faces&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; — two very different releases, but releases that reflected on the complications of fame, depression, and addiction. It is remarkable that one artist who died so young gave the world so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, my top track from this past year was by Mac: “God is Fair, Sexy Nasty (feat. Kendrick Lamar)” (65 plays) from 2016’s &lt;em&gt;The Divine Feminine&lt;/em&gt;. I listened to this song on repeat on my drives to work (back when I was driving to work) in late-2019 into 2020. I memorized every line. The song is a beautiful marriage of the soulful elements of love and the physical side — the sexy and the nasty. It’s a tremendously fun song with layered production and samples, and while I skip it most of the time, the outro of Miller’s grandmother reflecting on her late husband is a goofy but earnest addition that, when considered among all of &lt;em&gt;TDF&lt;/em&gt;, yearns for a long love, an old love, where one’s partner completes and complements them over decades of companionship (“We gon’ keep going ’til our bones both break / It’s the grown folk way”).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did dive into the unreleased leaked tracks by Mac this year, too. It’s a complicated, controversial subject, because it’s unclear whether these songs have been obtained through nefarious means, and friends of Mac’s have said that the leaks &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MacMiller/comments/iyfj37/an_end_to_the_music_request_thread_posting_leaks/&#34;&gt;have made things difficult for the late rapper’s family&lt;/a&gt;. But so many of these songs need to be heard — they show Mac at his most vulnerable in songs like the beautiful, tragic “Pure” (40 plays), where he raps a letter to himself, reflecting on his material success, drug use, and emotional health (“Everybody got opinions when you make millions / All God’s children, let me keep livin’ / I been keepin’ it real / I can’t sleep without pills … I been dealing with some problems, I been longing for your love / Crazy selfish doing drugs / Check off all of the above”).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything about Mac’s music speaks to a need. A need, for him, to share the world in his head; to find his way out of the darkness. It’s difficult to reconcile the wound of his death; the leaks are a band aid, but there’s something bittersweet in hearing him spit about the addiction that killed him. I find ways to push that reminder out, but many of his songs are steeped in the awareness that his lifestyle would kill him (“Am I okay? / Fuck no / Just so nutso / I need to let the drugs go / I try to find heaven, I get high but never come close”). But we can at least appreciate the beauty he was able to put in the world when he was here. I sometimes feel guilty listening to songs like “Pure” because Mac may have never intended for anyone but him to hear them. It feels wrong to intrude on that, but as “Oracle” (12 plays) concludes, “the people need to hear the music.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F6zIO_QMTc&#34;&gt;“God is Fair, Sexy Nasty (feat.

When Bandcamp Fridays first started up, Martha offered their entire discography plus a bonus album of demos for a discounted price. I jumped on it purely on the knowledge that they had toured with Los Campesinos! a few years back. I was not disappointed. Martha’s music is uncomplicated fun, with the breathlessness and, at times, incoherency of early Cloud Nothings. They shine with absolute bops like &lt;a href=&#34;https://marthadiy.bandcamp.com/track/clatty-harriet&#34;&gt;“Clatty Harriet”&lt;/a&gt; and the bright optimism of &lt;a href=&#34;https://marthadiy.bandcamp.com/track/wrestlemania-viii&#34;&gt;“Wrestlemania VIII”&lt;/a&gt; (“It’s like a cloud was hanging over me until the day we texted for the first time / And the world just got a little brighter”) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://marthadiy.bandcamp.com/track/six-men-getting-sick-six-times-mendable&#34;&gt;“Six Men Getting Sick Six Times (Mendable)”&lt;/a&gt; (“There’s a world outside where I feel so broken / But you make me feel mendable”).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s an effortlessness and easy appeal to Martha’s music. It’s inoffensive, in a good way — you know exactly what you’ll get with Martha and they deliver on your every want and expectation. Martha is an easy recommendation to make because just about everyone will like Martha. Martha sounds like a fun group of friends got together to make fun indie rock. In 2020, I needed that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://marthadiy.bandcamp.com/track/1967-i-miss-you-im-lonely&#34;&gt;“1967, I Miss You, I’m Lonely”&lt;/a&gt; (17 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://marthadiy.bandcamp.com/track/six-men-getting-sick-six-times-mendable&#34;&gt;“Six Men Getting Sick Six Times (Mendable)”&lt;/a&gt; (15 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://marthadiy.bandcamp.com/track/clatty-harriet&#34;&gt;“Clatty Harriet”&lt;/a&gt; (13 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsmrocks.bandcamp.com/track/heart-is-healing&#34;&gt;“Heart is Healing”&lt;/a&gt; (6 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;trust-fund-180-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#trust-fund-180-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Trust Fund (180 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust Fund again lends itself to my love of indie rock. I’m pretty sure I also discovered them through the Los Campesinos! tour connection — but even before that, I began listening to The Peripheral Ones, a cover band for The Middle Ones that &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/my-top-ten-albums-from-the-2010s/#chants&#34;&gt;I have previously evangelized&lt;/a&gt;. The Peripheral Ones led me to Pigthe, who surprisingly did not chart in my top ten this year, and a month or so later, I started listening to Trust Fund. It wasn’t until a few years later that I learned that the mastermind behind Pigthe is also the guitarist in Trust Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trust Fund therefore offers a similar sound to what I love in The Peripheral Ones: a bedroom rock group with an intimate yet catchy sound. I’m not sure when — if it was in 2020 at all, because time is an illusion — but at some point, I purchased Trust Fund’s entire discography, too, this time based off of my love of &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/track/cut-me-out&#34;&gt;“Cut Me Out”&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;No one’s coming for us&lt;/em&gt;. At some point this year, in my unsuccessful attempts to listen to more than just Mac Miller, I put my entire 97GB music library on shuffle to find some underappreciated gems. This turned up a few Trust Fund songs, which I placed on the aptly named “songs in my library that i genuinely have never heard” playlist. This included such gems as “we’re thirteen (and we’re drinking) and “Abundant” among a few others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2020/playlist.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;songs in my library that i genuinely have never heard&amp;rdquo;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The playlist ended up composed more of a Trust Fund shuffle than full music library, admittedly. While this anecdote maybe speaks more to my goblin-like hoarding of music than my fondness for Trust Fund, these are the kinds of connections and discoveries I live for. I love stumbling upon something new, something saved long ago that ended up becoming relevant again years later. Trust Fund did that, and they were able to stick more than a few songs and hooks in my head this year (“I’m alone in the house / and I’m freaking myself out again / I’m clapping my hands and I’m spinning my arms around”). They’re just &lt;em&gt;catchy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/track/well-both-apologise&#34;&gt;“we’ll both apologize”&lt;/a&gt; (35 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/track/dreamers-stefano-guitar-demo&#34;&gt;“Dreamers (Stefano Guitar Demo)”&lt;/a&gt; (32 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/track/sadness-demo&#34;&gt;“Sadness (demo)”&lt;/a&gt; (32 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/track/were-thirteen-and-were-drinking&#34;&gt;“we’re thirteen and we’re drinking”&lt;/a&gt; (32 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/track/abundant&#34;&gt;“Abundant”&lt;/a&gt; (28 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aether-175-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#aether-175-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Aether (175 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aether is the moniker of Diego Chavez who, in brief, creates awesome downtempo hip-hop instrumentals. I first stumbled upon his music in 2013, when I scrobbled his album &lt;em&gt;Artifacts&lt;/em&gt; (2008) an impressive 542 times. This was around the time that I was on the computer near constantly and liked downtempo hip-hop as my background working and writing music (shouts out to Emancipator and Little People, who also fall into this category). I more or less forgot completely about Aether until this year, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://aether.bandcamp.com/track/caparra&#34;&gt;“Caparra,”&lt;/a&gt; an old favorite, popped up in a shuffle. I thought to myself, “why not find out what this guy has been up to in the last seven years?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, he’s done a bit — Chavez has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/aether&#34;&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt; where he occasionally posts tracks. But because I’m old now and don’t fully understand Soundcloud, I decided to snag his 2014 release, &lt;em&gt;Solace&lt;/em&gt;. I was absolutely blown away by the title track (and first song on the album), and I listened to it on repeat for more than a while this year. The rest of the songs on the album are also great, but they blend together — which isn’t necessarily bad for working music. “Solace,” though, is the standout and deserves to have the album named after it. It’s incredible — the catchy, consistent beat, the abstract melodies, the skittering vocal sample all coalesce into a beautiful breakdown around the two-and-a-half-minute mark. It’s an absolute dream of a track that slowly builds then delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://aether.bandcamp.com/track/solace&#34;&gt;“Solace”&lt;/a&gt; (12 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://aether.bandcamp.com/track/untouched&#34;&gt;“Untouched”&lt;/a&gt; (8 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://aether.bandcamp.com/track/tomorrows-thief&#34;&gt;“Tomorrow’s Thief”&lt;/a&gt; (8 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tokyo-police-club-131-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#tokyo-police-club-131-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Tokyo Police Club (131 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was listening to Tokyo Police Club demos on my iPod Nano back in 2009 — that’s how far back my relationship with TPC stretches. Another indie darling, I’ve enjoyed the group for some time now, but they dropped off my radar for a few years. This past year, however, one of the many shows I re-binge-watched was &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt;, which features “Bambi” in an episode. It has a delicious and catchy guitar riff that shines through the Chuck Bass melodrama, and I was pleased when I realized the song was by a band I already liked. I went back and downloaded 2010’s &lt;em&gt;Champ&lt;/em&gt; after this discovery and kept it on play for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Champ&lt;/em&gt; is not a big departure from my past affairs with Tokyo Police Club — I was most familiar with &lt;em&gt;Elephant Shell&lt;/em&gt;, which released two years prior. &lt;em&gt;Champ&lt;/em&gt; features the same clean, catchy sound, but tightened up a bit. It retains the fun, catchy sound from &lt;em&gt;Elephant Shell&lt;/em&gt; but matures and adds definition. Funnily enough, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/tokyo-police-club/tokyo-police-club-announce-champ-anniversary/&#34;&gt;the 10th anniversary edition was announced in early December&lt;/a&gt; and will release in March of 2021. The list of bonus tracks is impressive — maybe &lt;em&gt;Champ&lt;/em&gt; will make my list again next year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://tokyo-police-club.bandcamp.com/track/bambi&#34;&gt;“Bambi”&lt;/a&gt; (17 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://tokyo-police-club.bandcamp.com/track/favourite-food&#34;&gt;“Favourite Food”&lt;/a&gt; (12 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://tokyo-police-club.bandcamp.com/track/breakneck-speed&#34;&gt;“Breakneck Speed”&lt;/a&gt; (8 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://tokyo-police-club.bandcamp.com/track/not-sick&#34;&gt;“Not Sick”&lt;/a&gt; (13 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;jean-dawson-104-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#jean-dawson-104-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Jean Dawson (104 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean Dawson is an artist who made me feel &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After seeing Dawson described as “glitch pop,” I knew I had to find his 2020 release, &lt;em&gt;Pixel Bath&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, Dawson is in this new artist milieu who seem to release their music only on streaming services and vinyl — so if you’re like me and avoid services like Spotify or Apple Music, you’ll be hard pressed to find a way to actually legitimately pay for a digital download. I forgive Dawson because it seems he is interpedently releasing music under his own label, but there are old people out there (me) who like to have digital copies of their music (me again).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Pixel Bath is a more recent addition to my library, but I’m loving it. It mixes so many different genres — hip-hop, rap, R&amp;amp;B, powerpop, glitch pop (which is apparently a genre) — in a cascade of sounds and styles. It’s an absolute joy to listen to, with some stand out bangers like “POWER FREAKS” and “Policia.” The former is a favorite of mine, luring you in with a slow, repeated melody until it rushes in with high power, fast rhymes that reflect on the experience of young black men watched by the police. &lt;em&gt;Pixel Bath&lt;/em&gt; is filled with unapologetic, boyish, raucous energy, like a paintball match that uses a Gameboy Color soundfont and speaks to Dawson’s experiences as a mixed-Black and Mexican teenager in the US. It’s an important album and a fun album.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CB5BzBNKYY&#34;&gt;“POWER FREAKS”&lt;/a&gt; (20 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUWKZLxopCg&#34;&gt;“Pyrotechnics”&lt;/a&gt; (17 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elSZfsrjOxQ&#34;&gt;“BRUISEBOY”&lt;/a&gt; (12 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrLRpQCt1yI&#34;&gt;“Policia”&lt;/a&gt; (12 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3hYjI3UnEY&#34;&gt;“Starface*”&lt;/a&gt;(12 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoGhwUxSmTc&#34;&gt;“Devilish”&lt;/a&gt; (10 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYUiCP3eMAA&#34;&gt;“CLEAR BONES”&lt;/a&gt; (8 plays), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmPdsM6gyGw&#34;&gt;“Triple Double (feat.

Unfortunately, there’s very little information to be found about shypig online — their Bandcamp bio helpfully explains that they are “a shy pig.” “celine” is a dark, mysterious, angsty track that absolutely rips. It haunted me for days, with its cryptic lyrics and obsessive atmosphere. It’s befitting of the &lt;em&gt;RIP everyone&lt;/em&gt; album title, at least, and something about shypig’s elusive nature adds to the darkness of “celine.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get Away&amp;rdquo; by The Internet (46 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found The Internet through Mac Miller, as they acted as his backing band for &lt;em&gt;Live from Space&lt;/em&gt; — as a group, The Internet have released lots of smooth grooves befitting of a jazz lounge. Those tracks haven’t grabbed me, though I can appreciate them for what they are, but “Get Away,” particularly the version &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6j49uzPugA&#34;&gt;from their Tiny Desk Concert&lt;/a&gt;, is absolutely phenomenal. It’s simple and pared back compared to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32HJ7PHnKY&#34;&gt;the album release&lt;/a&gt;, which allows The Internet to inject some of their typical groove into the dark beat of the original. Both are absolute bops, but the Tiny Desk version has a lightness and humor to it that I relished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ring Ring (feat. Clever)&amp;rdquo; by Juice WRLD (17 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Juice WRLD probably would have charted higher on my list if I’d started listening to him earlier in the year — he snuck into my library in mid-December, and I’ve been working my way through his discography since then. “Ring Ring” is a catchy jam that I keep returning to. Like with Mac Miller, Juice WRLD can be difficult to listen to — “Ring Ring” is a bittersweet song when considered in the context of Juice’s death, but I’ve found a way to shake that off and appreciate the music left behind, not the tragic cap on the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll Believe in Anything&amp;rdquo; by Wolf Parade (25 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is another song I’ve stumbled upon in a bizarre web of unintended musical connections. I found this song through reddit — some Ask Reddit thread I think where folks were recommending songs — and fell in love with it. But there was something familiar to the vocals — come to find that it was Spencer Krug, who originally recorded and released the song under his Sunset Rubdown moniker, a band I’ve been listening to for years. The Wolf Parade version is inarguably superior, as it’s a fully fleshed out track. “I’ll Believe in Anything” is a song about love — about keeping hope alive, about fighting for and finding happiness. It offered a lightness I scarcely found in 2020, a reminder of the things that keep me strong and the things that bond us all together. It’s a beautiful song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve both been very brave&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walk around with both legs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fight the scary day&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We both pull tricks out of our sleeves&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ll believe in anything&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;rsquo;ll believe in anything&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Wolf Parade, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll Believe in Anything&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;That I’m a big ol’ music weirdo should come as no surprise to anyone who has read &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/heres-what-i-was-listening-to-in-2015/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/revolutions/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/canopies-and-drapes/&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; it. I have tracked just about all of my music listening to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.last.fm/user/wearebeautiful&#34;&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; since 2014, both to maintain a record and gather minute statistics about myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turned 16 in 2010, and my 25th birthday was this past November. The latter half of my adolescent identity formation therefore took place during this past decade, and the music I listened to during those years acted as a score, a signpost, a catharsis, a reflection. I’ve come to mark events in my life with the music I was listening to at the time. And having spent my teen years sitting in front of a computer listening to music at pretty much all times, I developed a pretty large collection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with any post in this series, I do want to offer a few caveats and disclaimers. A lot of music came out this decade, by artists I love and by artists I haven’t discovered yet. I’m human. I haven’t heard it all. I track very few bands’ new releases, and instead seek out new albums as interest and whims guide me. So this list is limited to the music I actually listened to during these years and what music from that collection I consider influential on my personal taste or mindset. It’s very likely that, a few years from now, I’ll stumble upon an album released in 2013 that I absolutely love, just as I listened to and loved plenty of albums from before 2010. But this list will be limited to releases from the decade that I listened to a lot; I did briefly consider whether I would permit myself to include more than one album by the same artist, but as I narrowed down the possibilities, I found that was not an issue. I did not make any distinctions between full albums or EPs in my selection process either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-grimes-visions-2012&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#10-grimes-visions-2012&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #10. Grimes, &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; (2012)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2019/visions.jpg#album&#34; alt=&#34;Visions album cover&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;For the record, I am deeply uncomfortable being a Grimes fan in 2019. But 2012 was a different time — or, more accurately, 2013, when I started listening to Grimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme through the albums on this list will be that they mark some kind of notable shift or change in my musical tastes. I’d classify Grimes as “weird shit,” especially early Grimes, which I was no stranger to prior to picking up &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt;. But Grimes was a new kind of weird for me: in &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; especially, the vocals and lyrics are at times abstracted and indistinct. They’re like another instrument, layered into wandering synthesizers and catchy beats. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; sports some genuine bops and poppy tunes, like “Genesis” and “Oblivion”, but there’s still a darkness there — there’s also angsty tracks that sound like they were composed and sang by some kind of sewer nymph reaching out to be heard, seen, loved, but whose voice cannot travel far enough (“Soft skin / I’ll have you be near my heart / until I feel human / soft skin, oh / You were never in love to begin with / So now I’m suffering”). Instead, that voice remains distant, reverberating from a far-off place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s really hard to recommend Grimes these days, as she’s now inextricably linked to Elon Musk in my brain. But &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is still my favorite album she’s put out, and it’s absolutely worth a listen, even if it’s probably bumping the speakers in the Cybertruck these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R00Vu7Ag7s&#34;&gt;“Skin”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WizNXQGBMEk&#34;&gt;“Genesis”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9MXj9nVjkk&#34;&gt;“Ambrosia”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtH68PJIQLE&#34;&gt;“Oblivion”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txcZix5caF0&#34;&gt;“Infinite ♡ Without Fulfillment”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-oberhofer-time-capsules-ii-2011&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#9-oberhofer-time-capsules-ii-2011&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #9.

I discovered Oberhofer when I rewatched a season one episode of &lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt;, which featured their song “o0Oo0Oo.” This would have been in March or April of 2015 — which is also when I began dating my boyfriend, Joe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Capsules II&lt;/em&gt; became an early soundtrack for our relationship. For our one month anniversary (yes, we were/are big nerds), I gave Joe two mixtapes, the first of many I’d create for him throughout our relationship — one called “You,” the other “Me.” On them, I tried to capture emotion in music, tell him through I was through the songs that spoke to me, and tell him how I felt about him through the songs that reminded me of him. Of the 29 tracks that spanned the two CDs, because I was still burning CDs in 2015, three were Oberhofer songs: “Homebro,” “o0Oo0Oo,” and “Away Frm U.” The opening guitar in “Away Frm U” still fills me with nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Detaching the album from my own memories, it’s a fairly by the books indie rock tracks and surf rock revival, with some fun hints of Animal Collective mixed in for good measure. It’s catchy enough to sing along to, with enough depth to sustain interest. It’s the music you play when you drive through your hometown at night. But it’s hard to separate my memories from the album like this because Oberhofer is the soundtrack backing our early days. When I think back on the decade, I think about my relationship with Joe in the later half of it. So this album really is a bit of a time capsule for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMGdn4ojxtA&#34;&gt;“Yr Face”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z40oHofP3E&#34;&gt;“Away Frm U”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKMDY3T9eiM&#34;&gt;“Haus”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj_uKLk-dYM&#34;&gt;“Homebro”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-mac-miller-swimming-2018&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#8-mac-miller-swimming-2018&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #8.

I recognized the name and knew he was a rapper. I’d seen maybe a picture or two of him before, but I’d never heard any of his music. And yet, I was shaken by the announcement, for reasons I couldn’t fully comprehend. I read through pages and pages of folks pouring one out for another artist taken too young, grieving and despairing he never found the help he needed. I thought the only way to understand my reaction was to listen to his music — to pay my due to his passing, even if I’d never particularly connected with rap before (and, to the tell truth, hadn’t really tried). I downloaded his albums, skipped around, picked a few songs more or less at random, and rocked a playlist called “mac miller songs i think i like but idk.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just as I was entranced by Miller’s death, I was fascinated with his music. It was something new to me, something entirely out of my comfort zone. But there was something compelling — there was a pain and an insight to his lyrics, a density to his production. Mac’s discography takes some defined turns and evolutions, jumping between the ambition and optimism of &lt;em&gt;Best Day Ever&lt;/em&gt; to the troubled, strung-out suicidal ideation on &lt;em&gt;Faces&lt;/em&gt;. It was, at times, hard for me to understand or digest — except for &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt;. His last release was the most accessible to me; it was my gateway to Mac, to comprehending the life journey that led to the album’s creation and the tragedy of it being cut too short. I’m not sure &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; is my favorite Mac release — that might be &lt;em&gt;Macadelic&lt;/em&gt;, or maybe &lt;em&gt;GO:OD AM&lt;/em&gt;, or maybe &lt;em&gt;Faces&lt;/em&gt; — but it was a doorway for me to step through into Mac’s world. &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; was produced from years lived in scrutiny and pain, and Miller never shies away from expressing that on the album (“Well, I didn’t know what I was missing / Now I see a lil’ different / I was thinking too much / Got stuck in oblivion”). &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; is about walking on the pathway to peace but stumbling along the road. &lt;em&gt;Swimming&lt;/em&gt; taught me that you’ve got to jump in to swim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsKT0s5J8ko&#34;&gt;“Self Care”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B3YwcjQ_bU&#34;&gt;“2009”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbSuMV7ghm8&#34;&gt;“Perfecto”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnG7oL9Gg4o&#34;&gt;“Jet Fuel”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-how-to-dress-well--2014&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#7-how-to-dress-well--2014&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #7.

The ambiance and desperation in Tom Krell’s debut album, &lt;em&gt;Love Remains&lt;/em&gt;, spoke to me in that time. I spent a lot of time with “Ready for the World” on repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed How to Dress Well’s next release, &lt;em&gt;Total Loss&lt;/em&gt;, as it refined their sound, but it didn’t grab me the way &lt;em&gt;Love Remains&lt;/em&gt; did, and so I was keen to see which direction their next release would take.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What Is This Heart?”&lt;/em&gt; is closer, sonically, to &lt;em&gt;Total Loss&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Love Remains&lt;/em&gt;, but it hit me. There’s a pure emotion to it that &lt;em&gt;Love Remains&lt;/em&gt; concealed under lo-fi beats and distorted vocals that sound like they were somehow produced off a VHS tape recording. &lt;em&gt;“What Is This Heart&lt;/em&gt;?” is clear, honest, and beautiful. &lt;em&gt;“What Is This Heart?”&lt;/em&gt; dissolves the weight of older tracks like “Ready for the World” and “Cold Nites,” replacing it with a kind of airy lightness that doesn’t sacrifice depth. The album acts as an answer to its titular question — it’s How to Dress Well wearing their heart on their sleeve, bringing Tom Krell’s voice and lyrics to the center, no longer obfuscated by noise. The album’s bare-faced, earnest emotion is embodied on no track better than “Pour Cyril,” which retains some of the noisy, warbling reverb of How to Dress Well’s previous albums but mixes it with heartfelt strings and brass. There’s a heart to this album that is immensely vulnerable and is made all the more captivating for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbOCLEIKZOo&#34;&gt;“Words I Don’t Remember”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://howtodresswellmusic.bandcamp.com/track/childhood-faith-in-love-everything-must-change-everything-must-stay-the-same&#34;&gt;“Childhood Faith in Love (Everything Must Change, Everything Must Stay the Same”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://howtodresswellmusic.bandcamp.com/track/pour-cyril&#34;&gt;“Pour Cyril”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://howtodresswellmusic.bandcamp.com/track/face-again&#34;&gt;“Face Again”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://howtodresswellmusic.bandcamp.com/track/repeat-pleasure&#34;&gt;“Repeat Pleasure”&lt;/a&gt; (and a special shout to &lt;a href=&#34;https://howtodresswellmusic.bandcamp.com/track/repeat-pleasure-a-g-cook-remix&#34;&gt;A.G.

They made &lt;a href=&#34;https://themiddleones.bandcamp.com/track/goodnight-song&#34;&gt;charming little acoustic songs&lt;/a&gt; that were very of their time and place and are still very good. I sang along to them (badly) for a few years, and then they became another relic of my music library that I’d revisit every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jump ahead to 2015, when I’m lurking on anorak for new music, and I see there’s a Middle Ones thread. I give some of the recent posts a read through and find &lt;a href=&#34;https://anorakforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;amp;t=2918&amp;amp;start=140#p235243&#34;&gt;someone has shared a link to a Middle Ones cover album&lt;/a&gt;. Enter The Peripheral Ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love these covers. I know it’s taboo to say, but sometimes I think I may love them more than the originals. &lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a product of love and reverence for The Middle Ones, but it’s not afraid to experiment. Sometimes they’re covers with a new twist, as in “Young Explorer.” Other times, they include &lt;a href=&#34;https://theperipheralones.bandcamp.com/track/morningtime&#34;&gt;a “lyrical interpolation” of Nicki Minaj’s “Superbass”&lt;/a&gt; or replace the original harmonica &lt;a href=&#34;https://theperipheralones.bandcamp.com/track/yeah-roy&#34;&gt;with music from &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt; is truly a special album to me — and it led me to other great projects by the members of The Peripheral Ones, namely Pigthe and Trust Fund. It is a goddamn shame that &lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt; has less than 900 scrobbles on last.fm as of writing (and I account for around a third of them). Please do yourself a favor and listen to it.

Pigthe is also probably the most obscure shit to appear on this list, which keeps my hipster cred in tact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;every morning i wake up covered in blood&lt;/em&gt; seems, at times, to be a bizarre compilation. I don’t always know what to make of &lt;em&gt;every morning&lt;/em&gt;. Sparse details are available about it online, or even about Pigthe in general. Of its nineteen total tracks, eight clock in at under a minute long on &lt;em&gt;every morning&lt;/em&gt;. Four of those eight are under ten seconds. Scattered throughout are short, spoken word segments that are sometimes their own track (like “bad,” a nine second track whose complete lyrics read “The singing was boring and the lyrics were bad / The singing was boring and the song was bad”) or compete for attention over vocal tracks and strumming guitars in “JaneaneG++.” Other times, &lt;em&gt;every morning&lt;/em&gt; covers Mariah Carey in “Beautiful” or laments on the desperation and emptiness that follow from the economic alienation in late-stage capitalism in “Consumer Blues part ii” or composes a thirteen minute opus in “Not Enough // Not Good Enough.” But as impenetrable as &lt;em&gt;every morning i wake up covered in blood&lt;/em&gt; can sometimes feel, it speaks to me in a way I haven’t yet figured out or defined. It manages to be both catchy and intensely brooding at the many peaks of the album. It has stayed with me since its release a few months ago — and I think it will continue to stay with me for quite a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.pigthe.com/track/consumer-blues-part-ii&#34;&gt;“Consumer Blues part ii”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.pigthe.com/track/every-morning-i-wake-up-covered-in-blood&#34;&gt;“Every Morning I Wake Up Covered in Blood”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.pigthe.com/track/not-enough-not-good-enough&#34;&gt;“Not Enough // Not Good Enough”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download&lt;/em&gt; every morning i wake up covered in blood &lt;em&gt;for free via Pigthe on &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.pigthe.com/album/every-morning-i-wake-up-covered-in-blood&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-sylvan-esso-sylvan-esso-2014&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-sylvan-esso-sylvan-esso-2014&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #4.

The song’s lyrics might be about a woman getting catcalled in the street, but there’s a breeziness, an airiness to “Hey Mami.” It sort of spreads in your brain, and it sticks there for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as explosive and electronic as “Hey Mami” is, and many of the other tracks on the album, Sylvan Esso is also able to deliver a warmth when they pull back into muted beats and smooth, untouched vocals in “Coffee” or “Uncatena.” No song on &lt;em&gt;Sylvan Esso&lt;/em&gt; ever sounds forced, overproduced, or inorganic; it’s a wonderful fusion of beats and vocals. Sylvan Esso sounds like breathing in morning air with a twinkly piano in the background. &lt;em&gt;Sylvan Esso&lt;/em&gt; was a new, innovative sound when it first released, and no one has really come close to it since — aside from maybe their sophomore release. But &lt;em&gt;Sylvan Esso&lt;/em&gt; gets credit for being the first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://sylvanesso.bandcamp.com/track/hey-mami&#34;&gt;“Hey Mami”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sylvanesso.bandcamp.com/track/dress&#34;&gt;“Dress”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sylvanesso.bandcamp.com/track/dreamy-bruises&#34;&gt;“Dreamy Bruises”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sylvanesso.bandcamp.com/track/coffee-3&#34;&gt;“Coffee”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-los-campesinos-sick-scenes-2017&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-los-campesinos-sick-scenes-2017&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #3.

There’s a growth and progression inside their discography to which few artists can compare and which they have continued into their 2017 release, &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s something sparse about &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt;, which lies in stark contrast to their early discography and which I mean with the highest esteem. Consider, for example, the breakdown in “Got Stendhal’s,” when a lone guitar kicks in, then drums and vocals are slowly reintroduced. In the &lt;em&gt;Tweexcore&lt;/em&gt;-era, this might have been a cacophony of instruments all trying to be heard over the other. If you listen to a track from &lt;em&gt;HONY&lt;/em&gt; then compare it to one from &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt;, it’s hard to believe the same people were even remotely involved — and, indeed, much of their lineup has changed over the years, but they’ve kept true to their vision of being “your ex-girlfriend’s favourite band.” In &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt;, Los Campesinos! learn to pull back, to focus their sound into something deceptively simple. &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt; is Team Campesinos at their most refined and, I’m inclined to say, at their best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/here-s-to-the-fourth-time&#34;&gt;“Here’s To The Fourth Time!”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/got-stendhal-s&#34;&gt;“Got Stendhal’s”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/5-flucloxacillin&#34;&gt;“5 Flucloxacillin”&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Purchase&lt;/em&gt; Sick Scenes &lt;em&gt;in various formats starting at £7 on &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/album/sick-scenes&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-altj-an-awesome-wave-2012&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-altj-an-awesome-wave-2012&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #2. alt+J, &lt;em&gt;An Awesome Wave&lt;/em&gt; (2012)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2019/awesomewave.jpg#album&#34; alt=&#34;An Awesome Wave album cover&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;2012 was a rough year for me. I graduated high school then, but the months leading up to it was the deepest depressions I’ve ever fallen into. I felt totally alienated from my immediate world and circle; I cared very little for my schoolwork or my friends or myself. I was ready to move onto college and start fresh, with new people and new passion — but I had to trudge through six more months of high school first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Awesome Wave&lt;/em&gt; released in May of 2012; I don’t know when I first discovered alt+J (through “Breezeblocks,” like everyone else on the planet), but I listened to them a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; in the weeks leading up to, and into, my first semester of college — and just like college, &lt;em&gt;An Awesome Wave&lt;/em&gt; was something fresh. It was something new. To me, at least. And that’s precisely what I needed. It was a wave of relief — from my depression, and from months spent listening to “Hate for the Island” (from Los Campesinos!’s &lt;em&gt;Hello Sadness&lt;/em&gt;) and Xiu Xiu’s &lt;em&gt;Dear God, I Hate Myself&lt;/em&gt; on repeat. (Not the healthiest choices, in retrospect.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, &lt;em&gt;An Awesome Wave&lt;/em&gt; has perhaps lost some of its fresh novelty; it was eclectic and experimental in 2012, but we’ve had years now of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBskd3IaNw&#34;&gt;folks spoofing alt+J’s sound&lt;/a&gt;. I love it dearly still, perhaps for the sound memories it has left, the way that “Bloodflood” washes me over with calm, the way that “Something Good” is now forever attached to &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, one of my favorite games from the decade, the way I try to croon along (badly) with “Matilda.” The album has lost some of its neoteric magic seven years later; maybe it’s a nostalgia speaking, but I consider it a new classic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv-zbP7lyjA&#34;&gt;“Bloodflood”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNYjOVo5IEw&#34;&gt;“Something Good”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeMiVU77wo&#34;&gt;“Breezeblocks”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-stolen-jars-kept-2015&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-stolen-jars-kept-2015&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #1.

We ran a Pandora station on some rad speakers, but mostly I just zoned out or did homework. When I heard that percussion stumble on out, the song immediately grabbed me. I knew I had to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stolen Jars are not something entirely new or innovative, like some of my other entries on this list. Their music is accessible, even if it goes unnoticed by many. But what makes &lt;em&gt;Kept&lt;/em&gt; so entrancing is how ethereal it is. &lt;em&gt;Kept&lt;/em&gt; transports the listener to a dream-like state; there’s a warmth and a comfort to it, like being wrapped in a fluffy comforter and snoozing off into the clouds, otherworldly voices whispering that living takes time, asking to keep your hands close. There’s something organic yet mystical about &lt;em&gt;Kept&lt;/em&gt;, something artful yet catchy, something pensive yet grounded. Their lyrics are often abstract (“some nights / when I’m alone / when I’m alone / I’ll look through faces of old occasions / of places, scattered now / on small plates painted / just to know them”), but they evoke sense memories embedded in the reflections of fleeting moments — of waking up to see your partner bathed in light, of the train whistle in your hometown, of golden memories of childhood games with friends. &lt;em&gt;Kept&lt;/em&gt; reaches into our reveries and holds tight to them. The songs are all light and air, space turned sonic. It’s a beautiful piece of art that consistently leaves me in awe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://stolenjars.bandcamp.com/track/kept-2&#34;&gt;“Kept”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stolenjars.bandcamp.com/track/another-november&#34;&gt;“Another November”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stolenjars.bandcamp.com/track/wreaths-rakes&#34;&gt;“Wreaths Rakes”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stolenjars.bandcamp.com/track/waves&#34;&gt;“Waves”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;Another decade in the book, another opportunity to represent my life in lists and data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking retrospectively, this past decade defined my interest in games. It’s been a hobby of mine since I was a young child — I remember holing up in my mom’s basement, replaying the same minigames over and over in &lt;em&gt;Gus Goes to Cyberopolis&lt;/em&gt;. My dad bought me a Gameboy Color for my fifth birthday, and I dedicated at least a decade of my life (regrettably) to the &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; series. But in 2010, I started my first job, and so I finally had some disposable income to spend on my hobbies; I didn’t have to beg for games as birthday or Christmas or whenever presents. And so I played a lot more games in these past ten years. I started to follow industry news beyond new releases. I became more thoughtful about and critical of the industry. And I shifted my hobby into professional inquiry: in 2018, I co-wrote a book chapter about how video games could be used in educational settings, and in 2019, I piloted a camp that empowered kids to create their own video games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The games industry has shifted a lot in this decade, too. We’ve seen a renaissance of games that put character and narrative at their center, which has long been what I wanted to see out of the medium. Game designers continue to heighten the artistic potential of games, both in photo-realism and artistic expression. Put shortly, video games this decade have been &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to offer a caveat to this list: I obviously didn’t play every game that came out in this decade. I didn’t even play &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; games this decade. I missed major, beloved titles like &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; series, or any of the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games. Some of this comes down to personal taste, others to time (and monetary) restrictions. This list therefore will be limited to games that I actually played this decade, rather than some kind of pseudo-objective ranking of every game that released in this time frame — and I reserve the right to amend this list when I finally get around to playing &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editorially, I have also decided to omit remasters or re-releases from my consideration unless they dramatically transformed the content of the original game. I have also listed the platform(s) on which I played the games listed, as that may have affected my experience with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#10-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #10.

I’m sure many folks out there would recoil at it only just making my list; I’m sure it will appear at the top of most critical and personal lists, lists assembled by folks who are far better informed and well-equipped to talk about it than me. But here it is, at #10, even though it’s one of the games I pumped the most hours into within this decade (and threw the most curses at).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a rocky history with &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the games in the series that I’ve enjoyed and spent considerable time with — &lt;em&gt;Oracle of the Ages&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Minish Cap&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Phantom Hourglass&lt;/em&gt; — are either widely disliked or, at least, considered the lesser games in the series. I’ve tried a few times to play through some of the classics in the series, like &lt;em&gt;Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt;, but something never quite clicked for me in them. Other series staples, like &lt;em&gt;Wind Waker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Twilight Princess&lt;/em&gt;, were inaccessible to me because I never owned the appropriate console on which to play them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; was something different, both for the series and for me. To begin with, I had access to it: my boyfriend got a Switch not long after it released, and &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; was the driving force behind that decision for him. I later would get a Switch of my own, and the ability to play &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; as both a handheld experience and and a traditional console game seemed to help me stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; was also an entirely new direction for the series. While past games have had open worlds and a focus on exploration and puzzles, &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; did all that like no other. The simple act of traversing through the world works so, so well in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, and the reason for that is that it never limits you in what you can do. You see a mountain, you can climb it — with the right gear, food, or stamina, of course — but &lt;em&gt;you can climb it&lt;/em&gt;. The game never stands in your way when you are following your curiosity, and it rewards your wandering eye with breathtaking skylines, quirky characters, and new discoveries. Even after I had completed all the towers and unlocked fast travel points throughout the map, I would still choose to run great distances to an objective just to take in the splendor of the world, to enjoy the sparse yet powerful music, to meet other travelers along the road. This is why &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; eked its way onto my list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as much as I loved my interactions with with world of &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, I hated just about everything surrounding it. The story, while competent, did not deviate too far from the &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; formula: fight some mini-bosses (the corrupted Divine Beasts) to prepare you to fight the big bad (Ganondorf). While that’s a simple story structure that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; games can be reduced to, &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; does not add anything particularly innovating or exciting on top of it. And while Zelda is more of a compelling character in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; than she has been in some previous titles, she is still relegated to a damsel in distress role and is totally absent outside of the occasional flashback. I think the setup for her character is refreshing and interesting — a young woman attempting to discover her power and be worthy of the throne — but it’s still ancillary to the bulk of the game despite her name being in the title.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; also offers no incentive to participate in its combat; by a certain point in the game, I had plenty of resources and powerful weapons, so the random Bokoblins and Moblins were more of an annoyance than anything else because I would not gain any experience points from defeating them — and when you factor in the weapon durability system, I felt actively discouraged from engaging in combat at all because I only served to lose from it. On top of that, I often felt I was fighting against the controls; the systems design of &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; simply felt too ambitious for the limited JoyCon, and while a Pro controller assuaged most of my control issues, it’s difficult to swallow that the game almost requires a $70 add-on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then there are the shrines. My boyfriend, Joe, will insist that I hate puzzles and that’s why I did not enjoy the shrines in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, and maybe that’s true. I don’t seem to derive the same fulfillment others do from sitting stuck at a puzzle for hours until you work it out; I’d much rather just look up the solution online and continue on my way. Many shrines I found had clear solutions, but they would be so tedious to actually perform that I simply handed the controller over to Joe and asked him to save me the frustration. While there are multiple possible solutions to many of these puzzles, I found the shrines overall to be so disconnected from the magic of the world above them — like entirely separate teams and design philosophies had inspired them compared to the parts of the game I actually liked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It probably doesn’t help that — for inexplicable reasons — the game’s developers placed &lt;a href=&#34;https://zeldauniverse.net/guides/breath-of-the-wild/sidequests/shrines-of-trials/myahm-agana-shrine-myahm-agana-apparatus/&#34;&gt;one of the most obtuse, irritating shrine puzzles&lt;/a&gt; so close to the Great Plateau, almost guaranteeing that most players would discover it in their early hours with the game. I did, and it did not leave a good first impression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even with all these frustrations, I know in my heart of hearts that &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; is a phenomenal accomplishment — that it belongs on this list, that I secretly like it, because it does an open world unlike any game before it. Every so often, the game comes together in a beautiful harmony — I feel free, untethered, unrestricted, and in awe of the beautiful world before me, and then all my criticisms of the game slip away. And then I go down an elevator to a shrine and the din begins anew. I’m torn between that discordance, but it belongs here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-animal-crossing-new-leaf&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#9-animal-crossing-new-leaf&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #9.

I spent many a hours in middle school decorating my player’s room, designing custom patterns, and visiting my the towns of my siblings and friends. I broached the 3DS library late, but when I picked mine up in 2015, I knew that &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt; would be a must buy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I could talk about some of the more meaningful and enjoyable additions that &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt; brought to the series, like Dream Towns, Public Works projects, and more options for character customization. I could croon on about Isabelle, who I inexplicably and wholeheartedly love. And I could enumerate all the hours I dumped into the Desert Island Escape mini-game hidden within &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;, but I would rather not realize my shame and addiction on a semi-permanent platform like my blog. (I have since learned that Desert Island Escape is playable in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival&lt;/em&gt;, making me one of four people who purchased &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival&lt;/em&gt; for something other than the bundled amiibo.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; simply works in that it is one of the coziest experiences in gaming. While other titles focus on leveling up your character, meeting impossible combat challenges, or working out team strategies in cooperative settings, the joys of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; are often found in solitude. Even if I have only twenty minutes to spare, I can load up my town and tackle whichever of &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;‘s numerous offerings best strike my fancy that day: I can catch fish, hunt for fossils, or design my house. I can build relationships with my townspeople or explore the towns other players have constructed. And even while some parts of the game can feel a bit tedious, like filling out the museum or raising enough bells to pay off a mortgage, the game never forces the player to complete any of it: all of these activities happen at the player’s pace, and the game encourages a sense of leisure. There’s certainly room to go hardcore in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, by time-traveling or hacking one’s game, but what I love most about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; is how it respects my time and how it seems naturally designed for self-care. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; is welcoming and playful in its art, music, and characters. It’s a game for taking a mental health day (or hour, or afternoon, or week), wrapping yourself in a warm blanket, and escaping to a world that is softer than our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#8-final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #8.

As a company, they have released some of the most important games and series to me — I count &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XII&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced&lt;/em&gt; among my all-time favorite games, and the &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; series was my entryway into gaming as a more serious hobby and gaming as a community. Square’s releases in the 2010-2019 span were not such easy allies; the company clearly struggled to meet both the new challenges of developing high definition games as well as match the innovations other developers had made. Quite simply, they no longer enjoyed their top dog status. They lost the trust and brand recognition that blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/em&gt; afforded them, and I was actively offended by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIII&lt;/em&gt; series (!) and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started in with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; on a whim. I had never played an MMORPG before, unless you count spending the better part of a day downloading &lt;em&gt;The Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; and promptly uninstalling it after just a few minutes of gameplay. But I liked the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series, and it was free to sign up for the alpha. So I thought, &lt;em&gt;why not&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; quickly, even with the immense learning curve that any MMO would have. And I certainly had my ups and downs with the game; it is guilty of the infamously menial MMO quest design of fetch quests and killing squirrels to progress the story, of grinding out levels for hours just to access new content. Even so, I roped friends into playing with me, and part of my enjoyment of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; became the relationships and socialization that happened around it: I was able to maintain and reconnect friendships through &lt;em&gt;XIV&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to keep up with Square’s active roadmap for the game or set aside enough time in my increasingly busy life to justify the subscription cost. I’ve yet to even finish the &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; expansion. But every time I come back to the game, I’m delighted by what I enjoyed the last time I played, and the new content only seems to get better and better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; represents hope, then, that a game company can take a critical eye to their releases, do right by their customers, and deliver something fantastic. The game’s original launch was a different sort of debacle than their other contemporary releases, and certainly larger in scale in that the game was pulled off shelves and rebuilt from the ground up. But the team behind &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; were able to raise the game from the ashes, and many critics agree that &lt;em&gt;XIV&lt;/em&gt;‘s most recent expansion, &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;, is its most ambitious and powerful yet. And while I’m in one of my valleys with the game right now, distracted by the responsibilities of grad school, the opening notes of some Gridania’s field music are enough to wrap me in comfort and inspire me to return yet again to Eorzea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-marvels-spider-man&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#7-marvels-spider-man&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #7.

The Sam Raimi films came out when I was young, and they were exactly the type of popcorn blockbuster that I wanted at that age. I also played a whole bunch of the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt; video game on my original Xbox; it was one of the first open world games that I played, and I would spend hours swinging around New York City or, my favorite, climbing to the top of the Empire State Building and seeing how close to the ground I could get before I had to swing off to safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when Insomniac announced their new Spider-Man game for the PlayStation 4, I was excited to relive the joys of one of my favorite childhood games, in a more modern and varied open world. I made it a few weeks after &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;‘s release before I cashed in some coupons and dove in. I played every night for a week, and it was the first (and only) game I ever platinumed on PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; is simply a joy to play. The web swinging and traversal is fluid, allowing the player to zip around the city with ease and style. As entertaining as the fast travel cutscenes were, I rarely used the system simply because I loved travelling through the city so much. The game also has one of the best golden hours around; much of the action of the game takes place against golden sun rays and soft shadows. It’s a beautiful, beautiful game, and I appreciate any game with a cosmetic system as deep as &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;‘s. I loved earning all the suits and cycling through them, especially the comic book suit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story in &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; is better than it has any right to be for a superhero game. The twists and reveals are mostly predictable, but where the game shines is the relationships built between the characters. Peter and MJ have real chemistry, and the complications in their relationship are believable because MJ has an actual will in this version of the Spidey universe. She doesn’t want to stay away from the action and actively resists any damseling (and Peter’s attempts to protect her). Peter and Otto have a believeable mentorship, which makes his shift to Doc Ock more tragic. &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; cares about establishing and developing its characters, and it helps ground the superhero action in a human, emotional context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By far my favorite portions of the game were the sections where Peter was allowed to be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man: retrieving his homeless friend’s escaped pigeons, chasing down a garbage truck that took his trashed belongings after he was evicted, and collecting the backpacks he had scattered through the city offer a nice reprieve from the big action of the main story. Again, it helps to humanize the character and ground the story; there was a levity to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; that made it a joy to play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; was a triumph in how to make a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; superhero game — one that isn’t bogged down by a cinematic universe, one that doesn’t repeat the stories we’ve seen a dozen times on screen and in comics. Insomniac put their own fresh, original spin on the characters and the universe, making it accessible for folks like me who don’t know the character well while still being a satisfying homage to the character for superfans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-horizon-zero-dawn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#6-horizon-zero-dawn&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #6.

Sign me up. The setting looked unique, following our society’s fascination with post-apocalyptic societies but avoiding any cliches. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;‘s world is harsh for some, but there are thriving settlements and communities, diverse tribes with real identities, and, well, robot dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way that &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; contrasts its grounded tribal life with the high-tech machines makes for a visually splendid experience, often set against the backdrop of sweeping mountain ranges and decaying ruins. I found myself regularly pausing on mountaintops just to take in the beautiful, varied scenery of Aloy’s world, just as I did with &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a real sense that Aloy lives among the ruins of a world that once was, and the player discovers the story of that world’s downfall through some pretty incredible environmental storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; also focuses on stories that we do not usually see outside of novels geared specifically toward young women. We have had a prolific history of games about fatherhood — &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Heavy Rain, God of War, The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, to name a few — and many of them craft compelling, meaningful narratives. And fatherhood is important in &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt;, certainly: Rost, Aloy’s father figure, is killed in the opening hours of the game, but his influence on Aloy looms large throughout Aloy’s internal narrative and the ways he taught her to survive in their harsh world. That is all well and good, but &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; fills the comparative void that the industry has created for games about motherhood. &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; therefore distinguishes itself in that it focuses not only on a woman’s story, but the story of a young woman discovering her connection to her mother through the game’s narrative and, on a broader scale, Mother Earth. It’s not a coincidence that the person responsible for destroying the world before the events of the game is a man and that the person who works to heal it is a woman — a woman who goes on to create a female-coded entity to care for the inhabitants that will follow long after her death. And without spoiling the ending or events of the game (you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQIqoTHY2MU&#34;&gt;click on this link&lt;/a&gt; if you want to do that for yourself), &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; has a powerful final message: for women to nurture their daughters to be curious, brave, and compassionate women who can nurture the world under that ethos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of gameplay, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; offers a varied experience; Aloy has many different bows, slings, traps, and other tools at her disposal, which the player can select according to their playstyle and the demands of the combat encounter ahead of them. I found myself favoring the Sharpshot Bow for stealthy, high-precision shots and its tear ammo, which will shoot pieces of armor off of enemies. Enemy encounters were always varied, as the terrain would often shape one’s approach, and enemies of different types were present together, adding a heightened challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;‘s shortcomings are especially stark when you consider that it released just days before &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, and I think that led many to overlook it. &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; very much follows the “if you can see it, you can climb it” philosophy, so long as the player has adequate stamina and it’s not raining. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; instead uses an &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;-style traversal system. It’s functional, but it lacks the fluidity and freedom of &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, which is jarring when the games are played soon after one another. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; also has a robust crafting and inventory system — in some ways, I prefer it to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, as I can quickly craft some new arrows in &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; as I need them, which gives me the freedom to use the weapons and tools I prefer in combat. But the gathering and inventory management in &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt; can feel clunky at times, as the player is always having to figure out which resources to keep and which to sell off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All around, though, I have really enjoyed my time with &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;. Its world is vast and visually delightful, its story is gripping, and even the side quests have a level of care and detail put into them that other open world games struggle to embed. More than anything, it tells a story that actively values and empowers women and mothers, which few if any games do or do as well. I’m excited to see Guerilla fine-tune some of the clunkier aspects of the game and evolve Aloy and her world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-firewatch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#5-firewatch&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #5.

Its now iconic design features flat mountains against the glowing backdrop of the setting sun, rich trees to lose oneself in, and a lone firetower set on spindly legs for your quiet contemplation. It seems, then, to follow the Emersonian ideal of transcendentalism — of communing with nature to discover truth and beauty and the meaning of all things. It seems to be about living deliberately, separated from the constant phone calls and text messages and push notifications. But &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt;‘s realities are far from these &lt;em&gt;Walden&lt;/em&gt;-esque projections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Henry goes to the woods not to discover himself but to lose himself. &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt; is a game about escapism — about running from what’s tough in life, using solitude as a hideout, constructing fantasies to keep you from hardship, and the people we wrap into our paranoia as we jump at the shadows, afraid to confront what actually looms within us. It’s a game about learning that reality eventually catches up with you. We can only live in the fictions we’ve built to protect ourselves for so long, and the more we try to cling to them, the further we’ll be driven to madness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt; such an accomplishment is the way it is able to build human relationships through a walkie-talkie. The voice performance of the actors behind Henry and Delilah is terrific and helps create an intimacy between two people who have never met in person. And that, too, becomes part of &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt;‘s power — it forces the player to question how well we know other people when we only see the sides of themselves they have constructed. We are rapt as we watch their romance evolve, and we root for it even though we know it is doomed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt;‘s anti-climax is perhaps &lt;a href=&#34;https://quarterly.camposanto.com/the-end-of-firewatch-8a7d334a9586&#34;&gt;one of the most divisive in gaming history&lt;/a&gt;, and it brings those themes to a head. When you talk to anyone about the game, your conversation will probably — and circuitously — start with what you thought about the ending. Henry and Delilah’s relationship was always going to end this way, because it had to, but that doesn’t stop the player from desiring that catharsis — they’re simply looking for it in the wrong place. That density and room for debate is the mark of a great piece of story — we’re able to still talk about it and dissect it years after its release. &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt; stakes out a place in your head and stays in there. It’s a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-mass-effect-2&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-mass-effect-2&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #4.

But with &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt; releasing in January of 2010, I hold that it established an ethos that would guide the games that came after it — and that ethos is character.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; game was a trailblazer in its own way, of course. The level of choice, consequence, and cinematic storytelling included within it was unprecedented at the time, and it received appropriate accolades. But while the story is an enjoyable space opera, it’s pretty by the books — you play as a noted military hero who assembles a team of soldiers and experts to fight an operative gone rogue. &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; has its unique voice, and the story takes some exciting turns, but you’re still a hero who does heroic things (or, if you play Renegade, you’re a hero who does mostly heroic things with a sarcastic smirk and a willingness to line your own pockets in the process).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt; asserts that it is going to do something different within the first five minutes of starting the game — when the player character, Commander Shepard, is abruptly killed, then reincarnated two years later by rogue paramilitary group for what they make clear will be a Suicide Mission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From there, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt; does not launch any big twists or surprises onto the player. You always know that things are headed for the Suicide Mission, and you have to prepare as best you can for it. While you had the backing of the intergalactic government, vast military resources, and a highly qualified crew in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt; sees you assemble a ragtag crew in a patchwork body; your crew consists of hackers, mad scientists, thieves, genetic experiments, and generally disturbed personalities. Even those characters who return from the first game are grizzled by time, with shifting moralities. Most of your assembled crew could give a damn about the fate of the galaxy or Cerberus’s interests, but &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt; lives and dies by these characters. As you sort through each of your squad member’s personal traumas and help them find the peace they need before they join you on your Suicide Mission, the game posits that the way to overcome impossible odds and save the universe is by loving and caring for the people around you — of building bonds that mean they will follow you to death’s door (and, hopefully, back).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-life-is-strange&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-life-is-strange&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #3.

It was one of the few games that I felt represented me — that spoke to my experiences as a teenage girl, that did them justice, that felt authentic. I still feel that way. &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; continued its exploration of difficult topics in its later episodes — suicide, drug use, sexual abuse, cyberbullying — but it was never exploitative, nor did it ever feel like an afterschool special. It conveyed these harsh realities with grace and mindfulness — realities that most games are either too afraid to include or woefully mishandle. And in that way, it did justice to the stories of many.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I finished the fifth and final episode of &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, Polarized, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth: I didn’t feel that Dontnod delivered on its ambitious storytelling or tied up loose strings in its ending. I still haven’t quite made my peace with the game’s final choice, though learning about the time and resource crunch behind it softened it a little. But when I think about the game as a whole, I think about the good. I think about the incredibly deep and real and complicated and human characters that inhabit Arcadia Bay. I think about the way Dontnod masterfully uses licensed music to establish those characters and add an emotional weight to scenes. I think about the tension and twists in the narrative. And I think about how few games have been able to tell a story of this magnitude — a story that, by its nature, wraps the player in and doesn’t let go even after the credits roll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I think about how &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; is unlike any other game. Sure, there are comparisons one can make across genre or mechanics, but what other game places a group so often excluded from and terrorized within gaming — teenage girls — at its center? What other game speaks to the ways that men victimize young women? What other game gives voice and power and agency to these young women, refusing to sideline or damsel them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As much as it is easy to goof on &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; for its, at times, cringe-inducing lines or its rampant &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; references, it has a clear mission to represent the social and emotional realities of young people. And it manages to mix its ambitions for social commentary with a deeply affecting, resonant story; it never becomes too didactic or wrapped up in making a message — it’s always grounded in the characters and the story. I think about Max and Chloe and Kate and Rachel and Nathan and Victoria on a regular basis, and I was in anguish as I watched tragedy unfold around them. It’s a rollercoaster I loved riding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-the-last-of-us&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-the-last-of-us&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #2.

There are some phenomenal, emotional, impactful stories to be found within games — and I’ve included many of them on my list, lauded them for just that. But &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is in a class all its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing about &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; would make one expect anything revolutionary. It’s a zombie game. It’s a big escort mission. The story, on paper, doesn’t seem like anything extraordinary or new for the genre. You’re Joel, a survivor twenty years into the zombie apocalypse who has lost his daughter and been tasked with escorting a 14-year-old girl across the country so that she can be studied for her immunity to the zombie virus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; distinguishes itself is in the extraordinary execution of that story. Joel and Ellie are made to be real by the complex motivations and ambitions and stories behind them. In the opening moments of the game, when the zombie virus first emerges, Joel loses his daughter Sarah &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is about finding small glimpses of humanity in a bleak, punishing world. There is no easy mortality to &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, no clear villain or hero — there’s a darkness behind every character, a guilt that they have for continuing to exist in a world filled with senseless loss. As much as I hate Joel for his actions throughout the journey, I understand them. I understand that he clings to his concept of surviving at any cost because it’s all he has left. I understand the ways that he has been broken and twisted by loss, the way that Ellie represents his final remaining connection to his humanity. In the final moments of the game, when Ellie at last sees Joel for what he is, we understand that the world could do the same to her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is a game about love because somehow, after all the traumatic blows that Joel, Ellie, and the player share, we still want to believe that love and humanity can endure. We want to prevail and do justice to the memory of the people we have lost along the way. We want to believe that our connections to the people we love can stop us from being swallowed by the harshness of the world. We want to look for the light — and the shreds of it that are found in &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; are made profound by their rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-stardew-valley&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-stardew-valley&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        #1.

When I picked up &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;, I had just started on a new medication that left me an emotional mess: up and down, crying all morning, needy for Joe to come around and pick me up. I wasn’t in school, and my next steps in life were totally uncertain. It was a dark time for me, and &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; was my light. The game was a good distraction; I could sink hours and hours into it at at time and never feel bored. And it made me feel like I was &lt;em&gt;accomplishing&lt;/em&gt; something, working on making things better, even if that “better” was happening in the context of the game — like upgrading my sprinklers so I wouldn’t have to do as much watering or getting the town bus line reopened so that Pam would have her job back. &lt;em&gt;Stardew&lt;/em&gt; gave me comfort; it became my game for self-care. And even when things aren’t so dire as my first months with the game, &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is still like an old friend I can come back to whenever I need some solace or just to kill a little time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to pitch &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; to people. There’s an immensely personal bond I have to it, but on the surface, it doesn’t sound too interesting: it’s a farming simulator like &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, kind of, with shades of &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s more than that, too. And I think part of it has to be played and experienced to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2019/krobus.png&#34; alt=&#34;Please, don&amp;#39;t be alarmed. I am different from the others.&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Krobus has some of the best dialogue in the game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To speak more broadly, though, I think the message &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; carries is something we all need to help get us through the state of the world in 2019. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is about community — about forming relationships with the people around us, about rekindling our connection to the earth and to family and to ourselves. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; posits this message early on, through Grandpa’s Letter, which suggests that the “dire change” the player needs can be accomplished by rediscovering what really matters in life: “real connections with other people and nature.” That ethos becomes the reason for the gameplay loop: rebuilding the town’s community center and pushing out the capitalistic forces that seek to place us in endless, soul-crushing competition with one another. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; carries an overwhelming hope that happiness is within reach if we work for it — that we can regain and rebuild our connections to the world through good, honest work, through communion with the land, through taking care of each other, through forming a sense of community in our increasingly separate, disconnected time. Sometimes I need reminders of that hope, and &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; makes it all seem achievable — even if we know it won’t be as easy as picking some leeks in the forest or growing some gold star quality parsnips. It’s within reach, if we’re willing to work for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;honorable-mentions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#honorable-mentions&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Honorable Mentions&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.&lt;/strong&gt; I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Shadow of Mordor&lt;/em&gt; these past few years, and yet I somehow haven’t managed to finish it. &lt;em&gt;Mordor&lt;/em&gt; does not do much in terms of compelling narrative or world-building — which is shocking considering it takes place in the Tolkien legendarium — but what it does do phenomenally well is the Nemesis system. I hope to see more games implement similar systems within them — though the game has been out for five years now, and nobody has really delivered there yet. It made for some fun antics in what would otherwise be a pretty humdrum game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Order 1886.&lt;/strong&gt; Those who know me will know I was incredibly hyped for &lt;em&gt;The Order&lt;/em&gt;, and it was one of my biggest gaming disappointments. I liked what was there, but it needed more to it. I still think that the setting and characters are incredibly compelling, and I hope — against odds — that Ready at Dawn will have another chance to give the IP the second shot it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomb Raider.&lt;/strong&gt; I had never played a &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; game prior to playing &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, the 2013 reboot by Crystal Dynamics. I had also never played an &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; game, which I am told is very similar to playing &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. This game was surprisingly gay and surprisingly good; what I expected to be a fun action romp actually had an enjoyable story and gave some solid development to Lara Croft. It was a commendable way to breathe life into an old, aged franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sims 4.&lt;/strong&gt; I am a &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; convert. I clung to &lt;em&gt;The Sims 3&lt;/em&gt; for a long time, lamenting the loss of the Create-A-Style system (and toddlers, and pools, and other things). &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; recovered from a rocky launch and has turned into a streamlined version of &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; that I didn’t know I wanted. I can’t imagine going back to &lt;em&gt;TS3&lt;/em&gt; now — even if I did like the live neighborhoods. I’ve sunk a heck of a lot of time into &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4&lt;/em&gt;, and I think the team behind it deserves recognition for bringing more equitable and diverse gender options to a game series that has previously been quite binary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna).&lt;/strong&gt; I want there to be more games like &lt;em&gt;Never Alone&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Never Alone&lt;/em&gt; was created in partnership with Alaskan native peoples to represent their stories, their heritage, and who they are now. While the gameplay and story are relatively simple, they gave me exposure to a culture that I would probably otherwise know or see very little about. I enjoyed unlocking all the little documentary-style clips, which I found incredibly well-done, and the educational potential of &lt;em&gt;Never Alone&lt;/em&gt; excites me as both a gamer and a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Sun &amp;amp; Moon.&lt;/strong&gt; This &lt;em&gt;Pokemon&lt;/em&gt; game let me dress up my character, which is really all I ever needed out of a &lt;em&gt;Pokemon&lt;/em&gt; game. But it also streamlined a lot of things about the series, making it accessible again for me, someone who has flagged on it. Not having to deal with HMs alone was a huge difference from previous titles, and I don’t care what anyone says — experience share saves me time and makes it so I can actually finish these games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I commissioned the phenomenal header image for this post from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://naxdraws.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nax Yoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Follow the link through to see more of their work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Recently, my boyfriend and I decided to revisit a childhood classic: &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;/em&gt;, the film that jump-started what would prove to be an extremely lucrative and much beloved franchise for Disney. I first watched it not long after its 2003 release, making me 8 or 9 at the time, and enjoyed it, like most other children at the time. It brims with swashbuckling adventure and humor while maintaining Disney’s family-friendly directive. Unfortunately, with my older, more world-weary eyes saw through the dust of nostalgia, dismayed as the film makes no effort to pass the Bechdel-Wallace Test, which stands as an absolute bare minimum requirement for a creative endeavor’s portrayal of women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;congratulations-pirates-you-did-the-absolute-least-you-possibly-could&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#congratulations-pirates-you-did-the-absolute-least-you-possibly-could&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Congratulations, Pirates: You Did the Absolute Least You Possibly Could&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of women in appear in &lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;/em&gt;, only one of whom boasts a significant role in the film. Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Swann, the female lead and romantic interest of early-noughties dreamboat Orlando Bloom, best known for his turn as Legolas in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, possessor of elf-eyes and occasional gay lover to the hotter, more rugged Aragorn (disclaimer: I have not read much Tolkien). A pre-blue alien CGI and green alien body paint Zoë Saldana pops up as Anamaria roughly a third of the way into the film, a member of Jack Sparrow’s (Johnny Depp) ragtag crew. Her name is mentioned approximately once. The remaining named women are Estrella, Elizabeth’s maid, who appears in a brief scene (no more than a few minutes), along with Scarlett and Giselle, who are implied to have had sex with Johnny Depp’s character.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the latter three women exist, albeit as extremely minor characters, their presence can hardly be considered exceptional, as they are either servants or sex objects. That said, with a count of four named women compared to at least twice that of men, the film nonetheless coasts by the first criteria of the Bechdel-Wallace test: to include at least two named female characters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sole scene involving two women conversing with one another is the aforementioned scene with Estrella, when she chats with Elizabeth. &lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;/em&gt; thus passes the second criteria of the Bechdel-Wallace test (to have two women speak to each other), but the subject of their conversation leads to the film’s ultimate failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Estrella and Elizabeth chat about the latter’s impending engagement to Commodore Norrington, a man. The two women gab about it being a “lucky match,” given the Commodore’s high-ranking within society, but Elizabeth balks, in part because her fiancé-to-be tragically resembles Nicholas Cage, and also because she is in secret love with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a common blacksmith. The film therefore implies some sort of female friendship, as Estrella and Elizabeth are in close enough confidence for Estrella to know Elizabeth’s heart. However, Elizabeth dismisses Estrella for speaking out of turn (code for speaking to her while being a Filthy Poor), the power dynamic ceasing any sort of meaningful conversation about hierarchies of power, gender, and class, reducing their conversation to the mere romantic gossip of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we’re all men of our word really… Except for, of course, Elizabeth, who is, in fact, a woman, and therefore has nothing interesting or valuable to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;– Captain Jack Sparrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The limited nature of this conversation is unfortunate considering how easily it could have been elevated. Elizabeth’s rejection of traditional norms and values within the film isn’t limited to just her romantic choices (though that’s certainly the focus of her plotline) but also her fascination with the forbidden world of pirates. Elizabeth chiding Estrella for forgetting her place seems particularly out of character in this context too, as the audience is meant to understand Elizabeth as not only resistant to the structures of power but also as compassionate to the lower-class. Her shutting down the conversation may have been a mere attempt by her to avoid admitting her feelings for Will, but plays out more like the movie not wanting to waste time with the conversations of women and fleshing out Elizabeth’s character. This potential sits just below the film’s waters, but the filmmakers fail to surface it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This repudiation of society by Elizabeth remains present in the film, but mostly exists within the context of her romance with Will. She jaunts around with Jack Sparrow and outsmarts several pirates, but she is also subject to their sexual harassment, stemming not only from her captors (oh yeah — Elizabeth acts as the damsel in distress for much of the film) but also from Jack. Regarding the latter, his harassment of Elizabeth is played not to be disturbing but for the audience’s humor and enjoyment, like when Sparrow asks if Elizabeth might be hiding something in her bodice, gazes at her chest, and remarks that it’s unlikely given the size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The film thus attempts to endear the audience to Sparrow by way of objectifying and mocking Elizabeth. It seems a particularly ill-conceived joke as well considering that part of Keira Knightley’s daily makeup session for the film was a whooping 45 minutes dedicated to making her breasts look larger and to give her what she calls “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-517780/The-secret-flat-chested-Keira-buxom-pirate-girl.html&#34;&gt;the cleavage effect&lt;/a&gt;.” She described the experience positively in that same interview with the Daily Mail in February of 2008:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They painted my tits on me for the films, which is extraordinary because it’s kind of a dying art form – in the past, they used to have whole sections of the studios devoted to bosom make-up… And I loved it, completely loved it. Because it was the first time in my life I had big tits, and I didn’t even need surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While women are free to choose to have breast augmentation surgeries or employ other methods of making their chests look fuller, we must question from where the desire stems. Tabloids and media have scrutinized Knightley’s body all through her career, criticizing her thin frame. Filmmakers and advertisers have deemed her body as something needing to be changed, like when her breasts were digitally edited in promotional material for her 2004 film King Arthur. By July of 2008, just a few months after the interview about &lt;em&gt;Pirates&lt;/em&gt;, Knightley &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.afterellen.com/general-news/35471-dont-touch-keira-knightleys-breasts&#34;&gt;took a stand&lt;/a&gt;: while she perhaps hadn’t cared in the past, she did now. She refused any makeup or Photoshop tricks to “enhance” her chest for her 2008 film, &lt;em&gt;The Duchess&lt;/em&gt;, citing her pride and comfort in her body. A gorgeous, slender woman like Knightley — with fame to boot — of course has a degree of privilege in the complicated world of body image, as she more or less represents the ideal constantly presented to women. However, her stance against altering her natural appearance for the male gaze remains notable, especially when analyzing the first &lt;em&gt;Pirates&lt;/em&gt; film: while Elizabeth might quip about corsets, the film’s rebellion against contemporary beauty standards and progressive attitude towards women remains completely superficial. The film continues to perpetuate the very standards it pretends to diverge against.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To return to the treatment of Elizabeth’s character by other characters in the film, in another scene, Elizabeth infamously burns a cache of alcohol to create a signal fire when she and Jack have been marooned on an island. Lamenting his now forced sobriety, Jack quips, “there’ll be no living with her after this,” his personal twist on the delightful aphorism “women, can’t live with ’em, can’t live without ’em.” The truth in his jest is that a determined woman like Elizabeth (Jack is content to waste away on the island) cannot be borne unless one is intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the final battle of the movie, Elizabeth appears in a solider’s coat and pants; her dress was soaked and she had to change for decency and to avoid pneumonia (despite that the many men in the film are constantly drenched — the implication here being that women are more delicate). It’s a refreshing change from the corsets and large dresses she spends the rest of the film in (though she returns to them by the film’s end), but the shots with Knightley in the costume are short and easy to miss in all the action. She barely participates in the fight and almost never without the assistance of a man, usually Will. The conception of her character may point to a progressive portrayal of a woman, but utterly fails in execution; the filmmakers want to have their cake and eat it too. They mock corsets but seemingly agree with their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2016/pirates.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Elizabeth in pants&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anamaria too represents wasted potential in &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Caribbean&lt;/em&gt;, an opportunity to elevate the film’s inclusion of women beyond servants and sex objects. A fully realized character for Anamaria would have been especially notable as it would feature a woman of color in a non-sexualized, non-servile role. In her first scene, Anamaria admonishes Jack for his owing her a ship, implying a swashbuckling or sailing history on her part. But after she is established as part of Jack’s ragtag crew, she appears only in the background and speaks only to confirm her orders from Jack Sparrow or the first-mate, Gibbs. A woman’s presence on a ship in the era of course would have been notable, and Anamaria could have been an interesting counterpart for Elizabeth — inspiration to ultimately commit to a life as a pirate — as well as an interesting character in her own right. Once again, however, the movies see fit to not spend their time on such a plotline, let alone on allowing these two women to interact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-have-exactly-one-emotion-ever-and-it-is-disappointed&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#i-have-exactly-one-emotion-ever-and-it-is-disappointed&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        I Have Exactly One Emotion, Ever, and It Is &amp;ldquo;Disappointed&amp;rdquo;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Caribbean&lt;/em&gt; at least makes some effort to include women and bandies interesting directions and back stories for them but fails to translate them into anything substantial. It certainly had opportunity to, with many critics agreeing that scenes in the film ran long and could have been edited down significantly, as well as much of the plot’s back-and-forth reduced. That time could instead have been dedicated to developing these interesting characters, rather than the repetitive antics of inconsequential pirates. Yes, it’s a movie about pirates; they’re literally in the title. But why can’t women be those pirates? Why can’t they be a major part of the action, without having to be helped, rescued, or protected? Why can’t they exist without being madonnas, whores, servants, or scorned women?`&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I lack clear recollections of the franchise’s later films, though most agree that their quality deteriorates after the second film. From what I do remember, they fail to add many more female characters to the mix, though Elizabeth remains in at least the next two, and she is presumably given more to do than be rescued by Will (hopefully). &lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Black Pearl&lt;/em&gt; passes only the first two criterion of the Bechdel-Wallace test, but the test itself represents an ankle-high bar that, sadly, most films continue to trip over, &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt; included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I originally wrote this for an assignment in a Diversity &amp;amp; Education course; I have modified the tone and expanded the content for this blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;As the year closes, naturally I must compile experiences and interests from the period into data and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe I’m not being quite that heartless, but last.fm sure makes it easy to indulge that desire. I scrobble (almost) all of my music to last.fm as I enjoy having a record of my listening habits for both reference and analysis. This year I finally found a solid app to do so from my phone, too, though my scrobbles lack what I listen to at work, which is a lot, as well as about half the year of listening on my phone. Therefore, as we head into 2016, I’d like to look back on what I listened to the most in 2015 (not necessarily my favorite releases from the year — my musical discovery process is best described as stumbling across things years after release).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-nothings-904-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#cloud-nothings-904-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Cloud Nothings (904 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I returned to the embrace of pop-punk, infused with my newfound affection for noise pop and the authenticity that indie promises. Cloud Nothings’ first two album releases, &lt;em&gt;Turning On&lt;/em&gt; (2009) and the self-titled &lt;em&gt;Cloud Nothings&lt;/em&gt; (2011), chug along with effortlessly catchy hooks and explosions of distorted sound. &lt;em&gt;Attack on Memory&lt;/em&gt; (2012) and &lt;em&gt;Here and Nowhere Else&lt;/em&gt; (2014) perhaps lack the charm of earlier releases, opting instead for a more mature alt-rock sound, and I’m partial to the first two for their lightness; it’s indie pop-punk to chill with, that exude a loving and playful fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered them on accident in January of 2015, while browsing through Amazon for some CDs. &lt;em&gt;Here and Nowhere Else&lt;/em&gt; showed up as a recommended release and I immediately fell for “Now Hear In,” an ode to commiseration and comfort as Dylan Baldi repeats, “now I can feel your pain, and I feel alright about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found my favorite tracks in those early releases (both on &lt;em&gt;Turning On&lt;/em&gt;, actually), in “Morgan” and “Whaddya Wanna Know,” which capture the exuberance I associate with Cloud Nothings. “Morgan” repeats the same structure for maximum listener imprint, as a self-aware, disembodied voice chimes in at 2:20, “again and again.” “Whaddya Wanna Know” slows things down a bit, featuring an almost hypnotic chill that climaxes in the chorus’ falsetto. I challenge anyone to walk away from &lt;em&gt;Turning On&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cloud Nothings&lt;/em&gt; without at least one hook caught in their brain and a bit more spring in their step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6llxYzI5XQ&#34;&gt;Rock&lt;/a&gt;” (61 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIwUjz5Ywo&#34;&gt;Whaddya Wanna Know&lt;/a&gt;” (58 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqd3P0Jy58w&#34;&gt;Now Hear In&lt;/a&gt;” (55 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6FtHfJOW-A&#34;&gt;Giving Into Seeing&lt;/a&gt;” (52 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PsyKNO8V84&#34;&gt;Can’t Stay Awake&lt;/a&gt;” (41 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cDQxh8CN6w&#34;&gt;On the Radio&lt;/a&gt;” (39 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeGm51cCO38&#34;&gt;Morgan&lt;/a&gt;” (27 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_zRt_EmqoU&#34;&gt;Stay Useless&lt;/a&gt;” (22 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;brand-new-728-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#brand-new-728-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Brand New (728 plays)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I remembered that Brand New is one of my favorite groups this past year. I nearly matched all my plays from 2010-2014 in the span of 2015. I went deeper into their discography than I had ever before, both official and unofficial releases. Most significantly, this year marked the first time I heard “Out of Range,” an unreleased track that’s been floating around the internet. It’s a sparse, almost hollow track about detachment and a desire for belonging that haunted me on-and-off for weeks: “Am I a torn up, tattered, worn-out piece of fabric, not suitable to stitch up a rip? / ‘Cause I’d like to be tightly braided, gold and silver bracelets, / The type you like to wear ’round your wrist.” Bonus points for listening to the song at 1.5x speed, which brings out its Modest Mouse vibes and influences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year I also gave &lt;em&gt;Daisy&lt;/em&gt; (2009) another chance, after writing it off on my first listen in 2013 as too heavy. It remains a difficult, dark album, but one that I began to digest and admire. &lt;em&gt;The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me&lt;/em&gt; (2006) will always be my favorite Brand New release, but &lt;em&gt;Daisy&lt;/em&gt; definitely isn’t the disappointment I first wrote it off as.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhF1Xfg-9wM&#34;&gt;Out of Range&lt;/a&gt;” (128 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwICLInIl8A&#34;&gt;Mene&lt;/a&gt;” (45 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FfF9fIDqFg&#34;&gt;Limousine (MS Rebridge)&lt;/a&gt;” (35 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjPyvoLXPs4&#34;&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;” (29 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye09Th7KZn4&#34;&gt;Sowing Season (Yeah)&lt;/a&gt;” (22 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDVMFCgoS60&#34;&gt;Noro&lt;/a&gt;” (14 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FMeCcBfVwA&#34;&gt;Untitled 02 (Morissey)&lt;/a&gt;” (14 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;perfect-pussy-524-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#perfect-pussy-524-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Perfect Pussy (524 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fell in love this year in the backdrop of a Perfect Pussy concert, then another, and then another. I saw them &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/event/4010219+Deerhoof+at+Webster+Hall+on+28+March+2015&#34;&gt;in March at Webster Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.last.fm/event/4161751+Perfect+Pussy+at+Riis+Park+Beach+Bazaar+on+26+September+2015&#34;&gt;in September at Riis Park&lt;/a&gt;, and then in October at a car wash in Brooklyn. They blew me away each time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perfect Pussy combines riot grrrl frontwoman Meredith Graves with angry, emotive punk. The lyrics smack you with a frank rawness, Graves shouting over distorted instruments “since when do we say yes to love?” in “Interference Fits” off their 2014 release, &lt;em&gt;Say Yes to Love&lt;/em&gt;. It would be a crime to frame the group as merely the supporting acts to Meredith Graves, however. Drummer Garrett Koloski put on an incredible show at every concert as he hammered away in fashionable socks (or no shoes at all), guitarist Ray McAndrew went through something like three guitars at Riis Park, and their keyboardist adds a persistent, droning noise to bind songs together. A Perfect Pussy set isn’t x amount of songs; it’s a single, heart-pumping experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyVrZfyfeZw&#34;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;” (173 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R4YuekVuNY&#34;&gt;Interference Fits&lt;/a&gt;” (38 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HuEI2ExyMA&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt;” (35 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVmFrV0PQF0&#34;&gt;Bells&lt;/a&gt;” (33 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tW6CcuBNhw&#34;&gt;II&lt;/a&gt;” (31 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pigthe-322-plays&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#pigthe-322-plays&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Pigthe (322 plays)&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a journey deep into the internet to find Pigthe. Back in 2009, I found a group called The Middle Ones on Myspace. They’re a sweet little folk-pop group that plays with vocal harmonies, and I listened to them on-and-off for years. These days you can check them out &lt;a href=&#34;https://themiddleones.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was browsing a small forum that’s filled with indie music, and a user posted about a Middle Ones cover album, &lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt;, done by friends of the group, aptly named &lt;a href=&#34;https://theperipheralones.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;The Peripheral Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The songs offer a nice twist on songs I’ve had in the back of my head for years, particularly their covers of “Drops” and “Young Explorer.” But the crowning song for The Peripheral Ones comes in “Morningtime,” which includes, in their words, “a lyrical interpolation of Super Bass by Nicki Minaj.” Yeah, really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a creative and fun album for fans of The Middle Ones, and I’m sure those who have never heard of them can enjoy it too… &lt;a href=&#34;https://theperipheralones.bandcamp.com/album/chants&#34;&gt;for free download, via Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having loved these covers so much, I set out to find the individuals who contributed to &lt;em&gt;Chants&lt;/em&gt;. The Bandcamp page lists a number of Twitter accounts, but the only one that led me to more music was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pigthe&#34;&gt;@pigthe&lt;/a&gt;. Available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/&#34;&gt;Pigthe’s Bandcamp page&lt;/a&gt; are two albums, one free and one name your price, that share charms with The Peripheral Ones, with perhaps a more humored, indie-rock tinge. Check out, for example, the slow-build “Spider-Man” off &lt;em&gt;Welcome Back to Viridian&lt;/em&gt; (2011), which opens with “there’s nothing I love more than Spider-Man, / there’s nothing I adore like being sad,” the source of that sadness being the singer’s beef with Marvel’s handling of the Spider-Man character. The song eventually closes with a chant, “it’s stupid what they did to Jackpot, / it was stupid wiping the memory of Mary Jane, / it’s stupid pretty much any time there’s magic involved, / it’s stupid if it’s anywhere near the words ‘Brand New Day’.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://pigthe.com/discography.html&#34;&gt;even more via their website’s discography page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top &amp;amp; Notable Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt; “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/2-way-thing&#34;&gt;2-way thing&lt;/a&gt;” (28 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/hmb&#34;&gt;Hit Me, Baby&lt;/a&gt;” (26 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/fill-in-the-gaps&#34;&gt;Fill In The Gaps&lt;/a&gt;” (23 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/spider-man&#34;&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;” (21 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/international-wallflowers-anthem&#34;&gt;International Wallflowers Anthem&lt;/a&gt;” (19 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/orange-juice&#34;&gt;‘orange juice’&lt;/a&gt;” (17 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/any-other-name&#34;&gt;Any Other Name&lt;/a&gt;” (14 plays), “&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.pigthe.com/track/hell&#34;&gt;hell.&lt;/a&gt;” (9 plays)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous-songs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#miscellaneous-songs&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Miscellaneous Songs&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were some of my top, new (to me) artists for the year, but there a few songs I would be remiss not to mention for my 2015 compilation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make Out Time&amp;rdquo; (186 plays) &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;Everything Stays&amp;rdquo; from &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Adventure Time soundtracks, curated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/casey-james-basichis&#34;&gt;Casey James Basichis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/staypuft&#34;&gt;staypuft&lt;/a&gt;, fantastically compliment the (children’s) show’s nuclear fallout, Feudalistic future. “Make Out Time” is a short and sweet track from Season 6’s “Breezy,” in which Finn battles against depression and apathy with random hookups after learning what a disappointing, deadbeat criminal his father is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Everything Stays” hails from the Stakes mini-series; Stakes turns the focus to Marceline the Vampire Queen, who must make peace with her past and her vampirism as she battles against old foes. It’s a dreamy track that grapples with permanence and mortality, complimented by a gentle bass and ambient soundscapes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cut me out&amp;rdquo; by Trust Fund (130 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ellis Jones released his début album, &lt;em&gt;“No one’s coming for us&lt;/em&gt;,” under the Trust Fund moniker in 2014. Trust Fund mashes together indie-rock and pop influences to build a unique track in “Cut me out” that simultaneously feels like every song you’ve heard in the background of a car ride and an absolutely unique collision of cymbals and apologies. Of “Cut me out,” Jones says,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted this song to sound like Elliot Smith. Stefano’s guitar parts made this into a proper song. The ‘Fragile Alien’ bit I sort of pasted in from a different song so it has a different tune to the first verse. I felt smart when I did that. The lyrics do a lot of twisting around needlessly, but basically the message of the song is “sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song may be contrite (“I’m sorry if I accidentally implied, / I’m sorry if I explicitly promised, / I’m sorry if I swore on lives other than mine, / My cat, my dog, my sister, / I hope they’ll be alright”), but nobody in the video goes without an enormous grin for more than four or five seconds total.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Me &amp;amp; U&amp;rdquo; by Cassie (122 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My tastes thus far seem rather unified in genre, spanning the broad range of alternative rock with a proclivity in indie. I’ll throw a wrench in the works and introduce my other passion: R&amp;amp;B, pop, and hip-hop throwbacks from the late-90s and early 2000s. Off her self-titled 2006 début, “Me &amp;amp; U” spells out frank desire and sexuality accompanied by a heavy beat. More than a few of my morning commutes to school were spent listening exclusively to this dark, sexy track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fourth of July&amp;rdquo; by Sufjan Stevens (82 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somehow I’ve gone my entire life, up to this point, without ever listening to a Sufjan song. At the behest of a good friend, I dove into his massive discography and fell in love with the first track that turned up in a playlist she gave me. “Fourth of July” is a simple, heart-wrenching track about the death of Stevens’s mother (which inspired the entirety of his 2015 release, &lt;em&gt;Carrie &amp;amp; Lowell&lt;/em&gt;). It grabs and hypnotizes the listener with its sparse piano and looming ambiance as Sufjan repeatedly croons, “we’re all gonna die.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Angels&amp;rdquo; by The xx (71 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, it took me three years to check out The xx’s sophomore album, &lt;em&gt;Coexist&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a fantastic album that expand the whisper-tunes of their début, but shines in the acclaimed “Angels,” which features their iconic restraint. It manages to mesmerize despite its minimal instrumentation and plain, though heartfelt lyrics: “The end is unknown, / But I think I’m ready, / As long as you’re with me.” It deserves the praise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lazy Eye&amp;rdquo; by Silversun Pickups (60 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my early teens, I’d pass the time by plopping myself in front of MTV’s station that just plays music videos over and over. Watching it for hours a day, I grew familiar with their lineup, and waited with fervor for them to repeat favorites like Fall Out Boy’s “Sugar, We’re Goin Down” and Relient K’s “Be My Escape.” Among those tracks (though aired far less frequently than Fall Out Boy) was Silversun Pickups’s “Lazy Eye.” I paid it little attention, at the time, but something dragged it out of the recesses of my brain during this past summer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song cloaks itself in a chill strumming and smooth vocals until it peaks at 2:45: “Still the same old decent lazy eye, straight through your gaze / That’s why I said I relate, / I said we relate, it’s so fun to relate.” It’s an ardent, tender track with instantaneous charm and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cookie Thumper&amp;rdquo; by Die Antwoord (31 plays)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Chappie&lt;/em&gt; this year. It was fucking weird. I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post in 2016 before allegations about Jesse Lacey came out.

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Let’s start by making something perfectly clear: I love &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. I live and breathe &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. They’re some of my favorite movies, games, and comics; I’ve read more than my fair share of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fanfiction and have, over the years, spent a ludicrous amount of money on merchandise and other paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When someone, tasked with buying me a gift, asks for ideas, I give them one instruction: if it has &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; on it, I’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even if you’re not as &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; obsessed as me (it’s hard, I know) — even if you’ve never seen the films — it’s inescapable, as one of the most popular and beloved film franchises of all time. Even &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Luddites possess an awareness of the major characters, concepts, and plots; &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is a cornerstone of our modern, media-obsessed culture. Yet despite this popularity and its trailblazing approaches to special effects and filming, the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; franchise offers a mixed bag when it comes to the representation of female characters’ visibility and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;padmé-amidala-and-the-mystery-of-the-wasted-potential&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#padm%c3%a9-amidala-and-the-mystery-of-the-wasted-potential&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Padmé Amidala and the Mystery of the Wasted Potential&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the six films, women appear in the background and sometimes have a few lines, but even the major female characters (or character – there’s usually only one major woman per film) have little to do compared to her male counterparts. In Episodes I and II, Padmé (Natalie Portman) was a powerful political figure and her position was integral to the larger plot. In &lt;em&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/em&gt;, as Queen Amidala, her and her girl gang of lookalikes (one of which is a young Keira Knightley) fend off the invading Trade Federation and reclaim their planet, Naboo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She refuses to be sidelined in the conflict or to remain in safety on Coruscant (against Palpatine’s advice), choosing to independently fight for the freedom of her people. Padmé reaches out to the Gungans, the native people of Naboo, for aid in the Battle of Naboo, uniting them with her people in throwing off their oppressors. Yet she is also conscious of the oppressive colonial history of her people against the Gungans; she proceeds in &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Clones&lt;/em&gt; to share her place in the Galactic Senate with a Gungan representative and return to the Gungans their rightful power in Naboo’s political affairs and future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and her outfits are &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. I promised myself not to harp on about how beautiful Natalie Portman is, because that’s not the point and she’s not just the eye-candy of the Prequel Trilogy, but one has to respect all the extravagant outfits she dons through the three movies. I’m not usually one for costuming, but when I tried to pick a favorite dress of Padmé’s I ended with five or ten top contenders that I couldn’t choose between. All of them draw from European and Asian traditions, yet mix in a beautifully cohesive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fashion. It’s amazing, and they definitely suit both Natalie Portman and the character.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But above all else, Padmé is devoted to public service and democracy, and stands up for these ideals when Palpatine dissolved the Republic to create the Galactic Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/padme.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Padmé in The Phantom Menace, as she regally owns some bitchass Trade Federation schmucks.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe it wasn’t so smart to appoint Jar Jar Binks as a representative in the Republic considering he motioned to appoint Palpatine with emergency powers to combat the Separatist threat (although Palpatine was manipulating almost everyone in the Republic at the time — hence the “thunderous applause”). Maybe her outfits &lt;a href=&#34;http://iharthdarth.livejournal.com/4552.html?page=8&#34;&gt;are a bit absurd sometimes&lt;/a&gt;. And maybe she should have been a little more concerned when Anakin said that dictatorships and totalitarianism are totally OK. Lay off. She’s allowed to make some mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love can’t save you, Padmé . Only my new powers can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;— Anakin Skywalker, lady-killer (literally), as he strangles a pregnant woman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet in the Prequel Trilogy’s conclusion, &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt;, her political plotline mysteriously disappears. Deleted scenes from the film show Padmé in meetings with the Delegation of 2000 who, fearing a crumbling democracy, form the beginning of a peaceful rebellion. While remnants of the plotline remain within the film, those that feature Padmé in an active role fell to the cutting room floor – and with them, the ratio of her scenes to those of comparable male characters fell too. She instead becomes a spectator to political debates rather than an active participant, making it not only an issue of visibility (that is, the amount of time she is shown) but also of autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most egregious in showcasing her lack of autonomy in &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt; is her death. After Anakin falls to the dark side, Padmé dies because she has “lost the will to live.” The meaning (and issue) here are clear: without a male character and love interest, Padmé has no purpose in the plot, and so she dies. The viewer knew all through the Prequel Trilogy that Padmé probably wouldn’t make it (or that she would suffer some awful fate) given what Leia said in Episode VI and that Luke and Leia were raised as orphans. But her death as Lucas wrote it demotes her to an accessory of the male rather than her own person and seemingly happens only to propel the male character’s plotline: when he learns of Padmé’s death, Anakin loses any remaining shreds of his humanity and becomes Darth Vader. Padmé stands among many other female characters in science-fiction and fantasy films with undeveloped potential and who reinforce the idea that women exist only to serve and to support male-centric plots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-daughters-daughters-will-adore-us&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#our-daughters-daughters-will-adore-us&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Our Daughters’ Daughters Will Adore Us&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflicting with Padmé’s diminished role, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), the principal female character of the Original Trilogy, enjoys much more agency. She, like Padmé, is an important political figure and a central leader in the Rebel Alliance. &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt; opens, after all, with the Empire’s “sinister agents” taking control of her starship. In all her audacious and valiant glory, Princess Leia stands up to &lt;em&gt;motherfucking Darth Vader&lt;/em&gt; and pretends that she’s just a senator on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan, that she totally didn’t just fly through a restricted star system, and definitely isn’t a member of the Rebel Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through the Original Trilogy, Leia often directs and commands both her male counterparts (Han and Luke) as well as the Rebel army.  &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt;, has all the trappings of a classic damsel-in-distress story: with Princess Leia captured by Darth Vader, it’s up to the male characters to rescue her. Yet when they free her from her holding cell, Leia immediately seizes control of the rescue attempt, berating Han and Luke for their incompetence and lack of a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Characters notice and are annoyed by Leia’s domineering personality, but she’s never shamed for it. Han comes close to telling her to shut up in &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt;, but only so he can fly them out of the asteroid monster’s mouth that they accidentally landed in (“No time to discuss this with a committee” / “I am not a committee!”). He admires her spirit and sees her not as a princess but as a person (a relationship &lt;a href=&#34;http://decider.com/2015/05/04/han-solo-star-wars-secret-feminist/&#34;&gt;that others explore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://noblealice.tumblr.com/post/94473568731/ugh-like-there-is-literally-no-canonical-evidence&#34;&gt;more depth&lt;/a&gt;). The characters and the audience grow to love and admire Leia for challenging male control and exercising her agency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The metal bikini Leia sports in &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; is one of the franchise’s most famous (or infamous, depending on who you ask) images. She dons it when she’s captured by the gangster Jabba the Hut and becomes his personal slave; the movies never show the parameters of this enslavement, but given the outfit, it’s no stretch to say there is a sexual element to it. &amp;ldquo;Slave Leia&amp;rdquo; and Carrie Fisher became something of a sex symbol in the wake of the film. Some &amp;ldquo;Slave Leia&amp;rdquo; fanboys may claim the infatuation merely lies with the revealing nature of the outfit and Carrie Fisher’s svelte body, but there are undeniable fantasies of control and domination mixed in (she literally has a chain around her neck). But Star Wars fans have made recent efforts to rebrand &amp;ldquo;Slave Leia&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;Leia the Hutt Slayer&amp;rdquo; (a nod to &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;), as, in the film, she overpowers and murders her captor. The plot point then transforms into an empowered woman fighting against objectification and forced sexual submission, and reclaiming her lost autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-isnt-the-film-franchise-youre-looking-for-sexists&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#this-isnt-the-film-franchise-youre-looking-for-sexists&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        This Isn’t the Film Franchise You’re Looking for, Sexists.&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive study of women in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe, or even Padmé and Leia, but even this cursory look reveals the series’s burdened relationship with women. Of course, despite the many failings of the franchise to represent women, I am an enormous fan of the series, and I feel it’s not all bad. Growing up, Leia unquestionably influenced me; I loved this powerful, brazen woman who was also allowed to be tender and human, who matched and occasionally superseded her male counterparts. While I take issue with how Padmé is portrayed in &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt;, before that she is at least allowed to be clever and political. Mostly, it’s upsetting for me that that potential was wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I’m more prone to give &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; a pass because I love it, but I feel there are some positive representations of women to be found in the six movies. Happily, Disney seems resolved to remedy that with &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;. The film is still under wraps at the time of writing, and I’ve placed myself in a &lt;em&gt;Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; silo after the second theatrical trailer, but Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been featured prominently in promotional materials and merchandise — and she won’t be shafted like Padmé or Leia &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/daisy-ridley#page2&#34;&gt;if Carrie Fisher has anything to do about it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fisher:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, you’re going to have people have fantasies about you! That will make you uncomfortable, I’m guessing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Ridley:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, a bit.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Fisher:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you been asked that?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Ridley:&lt;/strong&gt; No, they always talk about how you’re a sex symbol, and how do I feel about that. [&lt;em&gt;Fisher sighs&lt;/em&gt;] I’m not a sex symbol! [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Fisher:&lt;/strong&gt; Listen! I am not a sex symbol, so that’s an opinion of someone. I don’t share that.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Ridley:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t think that’s the right—&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Fisher:&lt;/strong&gt; Word for it? Well, you should fight for your outfit. Don’t be a slave like I was.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Ridley:&lt;/strong&gt; All right, I’ll fight.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Fisher:&lt;/strong&gt; You keep fighting against that slave outfit.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Ridley:&lt;/strong&gt; I will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pervasiveness and popularity of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; poises it to be another dissenting voice against sidelining women in favor of male heroes. There are tons of female fans of the franchise, and portraying women more consistently and positively can only convert a new generation of girls to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fandom, as well as prove that action movies don’t need rugged, domineering male heroes to succeed; they can, in fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/27/sexists-are-scared-of-mad-max-because-it-is-a-call-to-dismantle-patriarchies&#34;&gt;actively and explicitly subvert sexist notions&lt;/a&gt;. I’m looking forward to &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; for a lot of reasons, but seeing where Rey falls in the lineage of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; ladies before her falls near the top of my priorities. There’s a solid legacy before her, but one with plenty of room to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I originally wrote this for an assignment in a Women’s Studies course; I have modified the tone and expanded the content for this blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

        &lt;p&gt;The harrowing process of puberty hit me in 2005, around the midpoint between my 10th and 11th birthday. I blame whatever weird hormones we feed kids these days, and that I probably continue to consume today, for its early onset, or perhaps I can deflect the blame to my parents and chalk it up to genetics — but whichever way, suddenly I found hair creeping up where it had never been before, dried blood on bargain brand, butterfly-clad underwear. Under oversized tee shirts, burgeoning breasts lumped together, hardly noticeable, but they would surely be big one day, I told myself with equal parts dread and wonder — after all, I had already donned my first bra, one of the first in my class, but certainly not the first to worry whether these new marks of my sex would throw my jump shot, bar me from swimming pools for twelve weeks out of the year, and shepherd me into the “girl’s section” of clothing stores where I’d exchange cargo shorts and sneakers for dresses and romances. I’d worry about entering middle school, about finding my locker and my classrooms, about making friends and who my future self would be, whether she’d look anything like the girl I saw reflected in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, it turns out that my chest would never be full enough to matter much and that I would leave behind that basketball of my own volition, sooner than I expected. I would realize that, much the same as I squirreled poetry under my mattress and concealed any tears to the quiet dark of my pillow, I hid from femininity all those years because I equated it to sensitivity and vulnerability, to love and expression, my paramount fears. I’m still afraid today. The great takeaway from my teenage years is learning to trace, to accept, to embrace, and eventually, to overcome that fear, but I didn’t reach that point alone. There are a variety of influences I could name and explore, but somewhere between all my petty and beautiful adolescent struggles, I found gaps in time to turn my brain off for a few hours with video games. Among my illustrious collection of the hallmarks of  the PlayStation 2-era were entries from the &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; skateboarding games; I practically salivated in anticipation over &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Underground&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; game that boasted a literally game-changing innovation: the ability to leave your skateboard. I ran and climbed through the streets of various settings in that game, reacted with shock and thrill at the prospect of a &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt; game with &lt;em&gt;characters&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; (for I’ve always been, at heart, a reader and a critic, who specializes in the two). And in the midst of the grinds and kickflips and hijinks, I would hear a song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was no stranger to music, of course. Like most children of the 90s, I began with Britney Spears and NSYNC (which I would, at the time, vehemently deny — and now revel in). But come my pre-teen years, I would exchange pop hits for what I viewed, at least, as outside the mainstream, trade &lt;em&gt;Oops!… I Did It Again&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;No Strings Attached&lt;/em&gt; for a copy of Green Day’s &lt;em&gt;International Superhits!&lt;/em&gt;, for memorized Simple Plan lyrics, for Red Hot Chili Peppers verses I was far too young to understand. But with its heavy riffs, scratching vocals, and best of all, a bass line that introduces and finishes the song, two bookends to my musical homecoming, this song was starkly unlike anything I’d heard before. Never had anything felt so powerfully &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt; before, something only I knew and understood, a song that didn’t come from the radio or my mom or my sisters. It was my secret.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So secret, I learned, that I could scarcely find it anywhere, because in 2005 there’s no YouTube or Spotify or iTunes, no endless library of music waiting behind a few clicks and presses. There’s hardly even an &lt;em&gt;internet&lt;/em&gt;. All I knew about ‘downloading,’ back when that was a new word for the world, was that if I ever did it illegally my family and I would be sentenced to life in prison and our computer would explode. Or something like that. Even if I had the money to buy CDs, Best Buy didn’t stock it, and a trip to the fabled (and faraway) Tower Records seemed unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was an addict; I had my first taste and I needed more. Desperate, I relied upon &lt;em&gt;THUG&lt;/em&gt; for my fix, removing all from its in-game playlist until it was just one song, my song, on repeat, over and over, again and again, until I had almost caught all the lyrics, until it became a background noise that I only registered enough for it to sew itself into my subconscious, to weave itself into the fabrics of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song made a home in my head and my heart as I entered middle school; eventually, on my 11th birthday, I would receive the only gift I’d ever remember from my dad, one he didn’t think of himself but outsourced to my sister, who was vaguely aware of my obsession, one he tracked to a hole-in-the-wall record shop, one that I would unwrap and I would spot a pair of headphones plugged into a hand grenade, all under a spray-paint logo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely giddy, I immediately dropped it into our trusty PlayStation 2, in the living room, for everyone to enjoy. But in the hubbub of birthday celebrations, I missed the first songs, not that I would have heard them over my impatience for track five. But my dad shattered my exhilaration somewhere in the screaming chorus of “Halfway There”, as he asked with a cringe “is this really what you like?”, as my stepmom left the room in displeasure. I refocused my ears and my heart sunk; I wondered, perhaps, if I was in over my head. But I smiled and nervously laughed “yes,” because even though the music is angry and loud and frightening, even though I’m 11 years old and not nearly punk rock enough for it, I was also possessed by the awareness that this was the heaviest music I had ever heard. And I really liked the idea of that, because I too was angry and loud and frightened, though I didn’t know how to express it. I wanted to become worthy of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That desire ignited me and propelled me forward, continues to today. The album, however, was more of a slow burn for me; the band’s following releases proved far more accessible and solidified my interest, but I would constantly return to that hand grenade, my fear slowly abating with each listen; one day I wouldn’t skip it in my shuffle, another I’d add one or two of the harder songs to a playlist, and the next find myself singing along, until today, a decade later, I’m queuing up such releases as Perfect Pussy’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://prrfectpussy.bandcamp.com/album/i-have-lost-all-desire-for-feeling&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have lost all desire for feeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m once again afraid of what pumps through my speakers, of the raw rage and rapture behind each note, the sensation that these are words and sounds that will literally kill the musicians if left unexpressed and unheard. I’m once again afraid that this album has weighed me and I’m not enough for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that copy of &lt;em&gt;Revolutions Per Minute&lt;/em&gt;, cracked and unhinged with age, did more than provide a suitably angst-ridden soundtrack to my teen years. It taught me to take a breath and to take a chance, to allow things time to marinate, even that which terrifies me — &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; that. It gave me the courage to stare down that fear, to recognize the part of me that wanted to be stronger and tougher and harder and better, and to chase after it; the courage to espouse unadulterated outpouring of emotion, in the face of years spent repressing and in horror of true, honest expression. It was the first song to change and to free me as a person, the first of many tiny revolutions that music creates in one’s life. I must acknowledge, of course, that my life has not yet been very long; as &lt;em&gt;Revolutions&lt;/em&gt; preaches in its lyrics, I’ve come a long way, but I know there remains a long journey left ahead of me. And the change I perceive in myself from age 10 to now, at age 20, may be nothing compared to other transformations along the way, massive transformations that may occur over just a few minutes but alter me for years to come. And that’s scary but it’s also okay, because no matter what road I take, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; road I take, will one day lead me back to, and I will discover the light within, myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Life is Strange Episode 1: Chrysalis</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; follows Max, the recently minted 18-year-old photography nerd, attending the elite Blackwall Academy. In the trend of episodic games, &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; centers around player choice, the butterfly effect being both a literal and figurative force in the game. It manages, however, to distinguish itself from not only Telltale Games — with its unique center and focus on two teenage girls, as well as its gorgeous, indie-film presentation — but also from just about everything else we’re seeing in gaming today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Max shares the profile that I’m sure many gamers, myself included, occupied in our high school days — the slightly dorky, quiet kid in the back, who drifts through the hallways with earbuds in, avoiding the ritualistic and cult-like social hierarchy. &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; manages to toe a line, careful that Max does not come off too snobbish or superior (a territory I am also familiar with) — in her journal and commentary, she expresses a conflict between wanting nothing to do with her fellow students, particularly those belonging to the “Vortex Club,” and acknowledging that many of them are kind or interesting and that there are rewards for giving them a chance. It’s a thoughtful portrayal of teenage and high school tropes, and one of the only high school-set stories to remind me of my own experiences rather than other media’s shallow and flat idea of what high school is. Fairly early into the episode, however, Max realizes an alienating factor in herself that I’d wager players may not find as relatable — the ability to control and rewind time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mechanic is a refreshing twist on the choice-based episodic game trend, and one that functions especially well in the setting. How often in our high school careers do we wish we could relive something — would we have answered the teacher’s question differently? Been more delicate to a friend? Wore a pair of pants that &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; rip down the rear? And yet, Max’s new-found power is far from a blessing; the player must predict the long-term consequences of a choice that satisfies them immediately, often selecting the option with less desirable instant results in pursuit of future pay-off. Like Pavlov’s bell, the “this action will have consequences” icon and accompanying sound began to trigger an actual feeling of hesitation and anxiety in me, an effect that speaks to how engrossing the game is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/consequences.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of an in-game indicator stating &amp;ldquo;This action will have consequences&amp;rdquo;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to resist the urge to rewind &lt;em&gt;everything,&lt;/em&gt; and to instead trust my instincts, though I struggled along the way. After every decision made, Max will second-guess her (and therefore, my) choice, wondering if she should rewind. Even though we can see the immediate consequences of a decision play out, it doesn’t make the decisions any easier to make than in a game like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;; if anything, they’re &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult in &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, because we always have the option to renege.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the choices &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; presents regard privacy, a motif that helps authenticate it as a realistic portrayal of the teenage experience. In most video games, an NPC will stand by happily as you raid their belongings. In &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, there are consequences for rifling through someone’s possessions — you’ll discover information you’d rather not have known, or trespass on someone’s trust and hospitality. Other times, you’re able to lend a sympathetic ear to, say, a girl with a secret pregnancy. Here the time travel mechanic works in the player’s benefit; if a character objects to you learning their secrets, you can merely go backwards with the information still in mind but without the negative ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the specific situation it appears in, the choice-based gameplay of &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; feels incredibly natural in the setting, as adolescence is traditionally a period of establishing one’s identity. What may ordinarily be mundane decisions, therefore, have an added weight.  From the very start of the game, reading Max’s journal entries, we’re confronted with the harrowing and persistent question that possesses every teenager, and that we must grapple with it every time we’re prompted for a choice: &lt;em&gt;What type of person do I want to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/bathroom.png&#34; alt=&#34;In-game screenshot of showing the back of Max&amp;rsquo;s head. The subtitle reads, &amp;ldquo;When a door closes, a window opens&amp;hellip; Or, something like that.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The title of &lt;em&gt;Chrysalis&lt;/em&gt; is, therefore, well-applied by Dontnod, not simply as a metaphor for the transitional period between adolescence and adulthood. It’s also a quiescent stage, a dormant phase, a chapter that enables introspection — which &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; also portrays, in Max’s internal dialogue, and through the recurring symbols of mirrors and selfies. The player is able to look at Max from both the interior, by controlling her, and the exterior. And like when taking a selfie, we’re allowed to select &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to portray ourselves — what light we’d like to place ourselves in, what expression to make, what message the picture creates and communicates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the topic of &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; placing selfies in a positive light, I have to praise the game for celebrating teenagers — both their good and bad — and teenage &lt;em&gt;girls&lt;/em&gt; at that. Having only just left my teenage years, I feel right at home in &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;. I understand Max. I relate to her. I see myself in her, and her in me. And that’s an incredibly rare experience for a female, teenage gamer. Now of course, Dontnod’s use of teen culture can be somewhat heavy-handed; some of the slang is inserted clumsily into the dialogue (“You hella saved my life”), some of Blackwall’s students are rather trope-y (at least, right now — they may be developed in future episodes, and tropes &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; valid building blocks), and the overall atmosphere of Blackwall is just a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hip to be totally believable. Even Max insists on using a retro, Polaroid camera. These problems did momentarily remove me from the game, but they are minor alongside an otherwise believable and realistic world. At a certain point, you’re sucked far enough into the painterly visuals, exaggerated sunsets, ambient soundtrack, or well-placed indie track (personal favorite song and perhaps scene? The birds-eye view of Chloe smoking to Angus &amp;amp; Julia Stone) that you don’t feel these bumps in the road. It pokes fun at the selfie (a character at one point tells Max to “go fuck your selfie”) and my generation’s addiction to social media, but it never extends to mocking or disdain; rather, these are important aspects of today’s teenage experience and they deserve to not only be portrayed, but to be celebrated. Life is Strange turns the stigma of teenage girls around 180 degrees — Max isn’t an enjoyable character because she’s “not like other girls” or any similarly misogynistic statement. She &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; like most girls. And she’s great. One character in particular could have flopped and ruined the entire experience of &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, fallen into the manic pixie dream girl trope that lines modern-media — and gratefully, that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Max represents the incubation period implied by the episode’s title, Chloe is the hard outer shell. Despite being heavily advertised, Chloe doesn’t make a formal appearance until at least halfway through the episode — but her introduction is all the more exciting for it. She has this sort of looming, mysterious presence before we actually see her, let alone are introduced to her &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; Chloe — through Max’s journal, we learn the girls’ backstory: they were inseparable until Max moved to Seattle and, for whatever reason, never contacted Chloe again. When the two eventually reunite, Chloe isn’t at all what Max expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/chloe.png&#34; alt=&#34;In-game screenshot of Chloe, a young woman with blue hair and tattoos&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I won’t beat around the bush. I love Chloe.  I spent less than two hours with Chloe and I think she has the potential to be one of this gen’s most memorable characters. She could easily have become a pothole on the manic pixie dream girl (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/&#34;&gt;despite noted issues with the term&lt;/a&gt;), wish-fulfillment road, and to be fair, there is a degree of this going on. But &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl&#34;&gt;as TV Tropes notes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite all that (or &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of all that), &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools&#34; title=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools&#34;&gt;there are ways of utilizing this trope without falling into that pitfall&lt;/a&gt;. Given enough time, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment&#34; title=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment&#34;&gt;Character Development&lt;/a&gt; can add to their personality and interests and pull them away from the MPDG foundation. The story may even be told from &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchingPOV&#34; title=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchingPOV&#34;&gt;their perspective&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that there is more to them than bringing adventure to brooding guys. &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction&#34; title=&#34;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction&#34;&gt;Deconstructions&lt;/a&gt; of the idea may show that they resent being considered only useful for the benefit of the main character, idolized as something that they are not, or that once the main character reaches their “enlightened” stage, the MPDG moves on to the next person who needs their help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In just the first episode, Chloe has already been fleshed out better than anything other character (rightfully so, as she’s the deuteragonist) besides Max, with enough mystery to carry us through more development and character arcs. She boasts a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/lis-abandonment.png&#34;&gt;mix of abandonment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/lis-dad.png&#34;&gt;daddy issues&lt;/a&gt;, is an assault survivor, and has a seriously dysfunctional home situation. Again, Dontnod treads some dangerous ground here, but has yet to use step in any cringe-worthy manner (that I picked up on, at least). It’s refreshing to see these issues portrayed in a character without them overwhelming or otherwise &lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt; the character. Chloe isn’t interesting because she’s had a rough life; she’s more relatable and realistic for it, but these traits aren’t thrown in carelessly. She’s a character with an immense energy, depth, and charisma. She’s tough and she’s complicated and she refuses to take shit from anyone, even Max. I’ve scarcely seen this level of nuance in female characters, let alone &lt;em&gt;supporting&lt;/em&gt; female characters, in video games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and she’s &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; queer, based off of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/chloe-posters.png&#34;&gt;some of her decorative choices&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/chloe-rachel.png&#34;&gt;affectionate descriptions of Rachel&lt;/a&gt;. I’m aware that I have perhaps cultivated a reputation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/princess-bubblegum-marceline-still-just-almost-girlfriends/&#34; title=&#34;Princess Bubblegum &amp;amp; Marceline: Still Just Almost Girlfriends&#34;&gt;assuming most female characters are queer&lt;/a&gt;, even without pre-existing subtext — I don’t deny that. But as infatuated as I am with Chloe, as both a character and for what she represents, I don’t think I’m reaching here. That said, at its heart — without the science-fiction and supernatural elements — &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; is a story of female friendship, how two young women reunite and support one another as they face adulthood. Despite both being rather pragmatic, they acknowledge that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; — destiny, perhaps? the butterfly? — brought them together for a reason. It’s no coincidence that Max’s powers appear just in time to save Chloe’s life. Whether romance becomes part of that remains to be seen; even with my inclination to pair off female characters, Max and Chloe’s interactions have been fairly platonic thus far. I’d be delighted to see that change, but equally pleased if Dontnod makes a conscious design to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change it — to instead craft a (female) bildungsroman that doesn’t culminate in romance, and to celebrate female friendship and sisterhood without sexualizing it or its characters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.cassie.ink/images/2015/lis-sunset.png&#34; alt=&#34;In-game screenshot of Max and Chloe watching a sunset&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;‘s first episode managed to deliver on, and exceed, every one of my expectations for it. The first chapter concludes with a slideshow of the vivid characters encountered, who will no doubt hold further significance to the story as Arcadia Bay’s many mysteries unfold, all under the foreboding threat of a coming storm — the tornado Max dreams will hit the town in just four days. As the episode faded out, I watched the credits roll by, the incredible mood and atmosphere still encircling me, and it lingered for days after. There is still so much for me to explore in-game and to talk about outside of it; if nothing else, that’s the mark of a fantastic release — one that inspires me to talk about it, to analyze it; one that draws me into it and &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to it several times. &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; is not a game that anyone would bank on as a success in an industry so inundated with guns held by rugged white guys; it set out with a vision to create a modern-day, women-driven &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;, and succeeded. It’s a refreshing change from an industry that is otherwise rather trapped in sameness and stagnation. I have a big journey left to take with Max and Chloe and, judging by its first steps, it will be quite a ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve picked up &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt; again, Mark Z. Danielewski’s debut novel and veritable puzzle of a book. I previously abandoned it because, as a horror novel, I was having some trouble sleeping after reading it, but I’ve wanted to read it for years and the new year seems like a good time to conquer my fears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of discussion around the internet regarding the book, and plenty more people who, I’m sure, have decoded the book’s many coded messages. But I’m a stingy sort who likes to do things on my own, and I thought I’d log some of it here! The first of my challenges was a letter from Appendix II-E, sent to Johnny Truant from his mother; she suspects that the director of the Whalestoe Institute, where she is institutionalized, is intercepting her letters. She is able to send a private letter to Johnny via an attendant, telling him the key to her next letter: take only the first letter of each word, separate those letters into something coherent, and find her true message (the letter itself is pure nonsense). Therefore, it’s no significant discovery on my part, but more of a fun first challenge. Warning that this is a book of psychological horror, and the contents below may be troubling or triggering (esp. for rape victims).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I won’t bother re-typing the entirety of the letter because, as I said, it’s nonsensical. However, when the first letter of each word is taken, I’ve come up with the following message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May 8th, 1987&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dearest Johnny,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have found a way to break me. Rape a fifty-six year old bag of bones. There is no worse and don’t believe otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The attendants do it. Others do it. Not every day, not every week, maybe not even every month. But they do it. Someone I don’t know always comes. When it’s dark. Late. I’ve learned not to scream, screaming gave me hope and unanswered hope is shattered hope. Think of your Haitian. It is far saner to choose rape than shattered hope. So I submit and I drift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I let caprice and a certain degree of free association take me away. Sometimes I’m still away long after it’s done, after he’s gone — the stranger, the attendant, the custodian, the janitor, cleaning man, waiting man, dirty man — the night tidying up after him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m in hell giving into heaven where I sometimes think of your beautiful father with his dreamy wings and only then do I allow myself to cry. Not because your mother was raped (again) but because she loved so much what she could never have been allowed to keep. Such a silly girl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You must save me Johnny. In the name of your father. I must escape this place or I will die.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love you so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are all I have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, throughout the letter, letters are capitalized in the middle of words (ex. ‘froWned’). When those letters are collected, it spells the following message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A face in a cloud no trace in the crowd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This omits the MAN from “Man and Nam,” which have appeared between the o and w of ‘crowd.’ I have found no solution to their capitalization — yet?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The phrase felt familiar once I found it, so I googled it, despite my resolve to figure out the puzzles myself (if possible) — I received only results for House of Leaves — perhaps I read it on tumblr somewhere? — but Google confirmed my suspicion that the Whalestoe Letters contain plenty more secrets to uncover (I’ve not read past the May 8th letter yet). I look forward to unfolding them!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;comments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#comments&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        Comments&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; width=&#34;24&#34; height=&#34;24&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; class=&#34;icon icon-tabler icons-tabler-outline icon-tabler-link&#34;&gt;&lt;path stroke=&#34;none&#34; d=&#34;M0 0h24v24H0z&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M9 15l6 -6&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M11 6l.463 -.536a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 7.072l-.534 .464&#34; /&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M13 18l-.397 .534a5.068 5.068 0 0 1 -7.127 0a4.972 4.972 0 0 1 0 -7.071l.524 -.463&#34; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer (2020-10-10):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul (2020-11-14):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5 years later and I say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control (2021-07-26):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Appreciate the work, thank you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelby West (2021-08-02):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6 years later!

      <title>Canopies and Drapes: Emmy the Great’s Twist on the Classic Breakup Song</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/canopies-and-drapes/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;In the music industry, and in the folk genre particular, breakup songs are not exactly uncommon, and for every chart-topping artist crooning over the radio about the throes of love, there are thousands of disconsolate teens pouring over their guitars. For her 2009 &lt;em&gt;Edward&lt;/em&gt; EP, England-based singer-songwriter Emma-Lee Moss (stage name Emmy the Great) visits the genre herself; the four included songs are among Emmy’s earliest, though they contain her usual balance of charm and poignancy, more often than not accompanied only by an acoustic strum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though she rather spontaneously released &lt;em&gt;Edward&lt;/em&gt; after her début album, &lt;em&gt;First Love,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Edward&lt;/em&gt; nonetheless functions as a prequel to &lt;em&gt;First Love&lt;/em&gt;, as the two share the ubiquitous themes of love, death, and sex.  It is within the elegiac third track, “Canopies and Drapes”, that Emmy explores the uniquely teenage voice and experience of losing one’s first love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The maudlin emotions of a teenager in love are all too frequently dismissed by the older and wiser, who attribute those feelings to the undulations of hormones — and that genuinely may be their source, but they are nonetheless legitimate to the teens experiencing them, a reality that those who have survived adolescence must not forget.  The song’s bathetic speaker laments early on that she “hate[s] the day,  it hates me, [and] so does everybody else,” an almost cliché embodiment of the heartbroken teen. Yet it is the teenagerhood of the speaker and the song that makes it so endearing, as it captures and honors a teen in search of identity, attention, and closure, whose youth affords her only one frame of reference for her misery: that she “feel[s] worse than when S Club 7 broke up.” As she absently watches “another routine episode of &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt;,” she forms her conception of adulthood from its characters, wondering if her future life will be filled with “feelings, coffee, and ‘I’ll be there for you’.” This references not only how teens build their perceptions of reality from the media — an idea echoed through the song — but also how she struggles to define herself and her life when  “[I have] loved you so long, I don’t know who I’d be without.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Musical references make a reappearance a few verses later, and serve as outlets for her sorrow — songs to cry to and relate to, artists to accompany her in the lonely days that follow. And yet, she cannot separate certain albums and movies from their roots in or resemblance of her relationship, and they become mementos of her beloved boy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wish I could tell you all the things Woody Allen helps me see,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;How &lt;em&gt;Annie Hall&lt;/em&gt; is beginning to feel quite a lot like you and me.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It took a while to come around to David Bowie’s new CD,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And it’s much too late to give back your &lt;em&gt;Magnetic Fields&lt;/em&gt; EP.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Can I keep it by my pillow?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Really loved it…&lt;br&gt;&#xA;How I long to tell you so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This desperation for contact with her ex repeats through the song, craving their lost intimacy and companionship; while they are not proud moments for us, I’m sure most would admit to having scrolled through an ex-lover or crush’s Facebook photos and tweets, desiring to know what they’re up to and, perhaps most importantly, who they’re up to it &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;. The speaker quenches her thirst, literally and metaphorically, and dejectedly attempts to gain her ex’s attention in the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later on me and a bottle will hook up to have some fun,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Then I’ll call your house at twelve to let you know that I’m drunk,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Say ‘I’m sorry Mr. C, I was just looking for your son,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;How is he, incidentally do you know if he’s out alone?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There is this book he lent to me something like seven months ago,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’m gonna burn it in the street, be so kind as to let him know that I’m dealing with this badly,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and could he please get back to me?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s a bitterness here, a selfish hunger to not be alone in her downward spiral; in short, a desire to stop him from moving on, to ensure he also experiences the hurt she is so overcome by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping to form, the song ends with forward steps; she sleeps, dreaming of the titular “canopies and drapes,” and “wake[s] shaking from the knowledge that the mattress holds your shape.” She gradually replaces her acidity and need for attention with a desire for closure, illustrated by the image of a funeral, where she hopes once again to see her ex, but this time to “give back your music and your tee-shirts and your socks.” She begins to project into the future, where the speaker’s voice becomes more mature, and Emmy’s idyllic, poetic songwriting abilities shine through:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[I’ll] walk to Jazz’s house in Soho, cry into her letterbox,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Take some time out to resuscitate my soul,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Take up smoking and drink carrot juice and grow,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Teach the mattress to erase you from its folds,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Then dry my eyes and keep on moving ’til the motion makes me strong,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Until one day I realize I don’t remember that you’re gone.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We’ll be strangers who were lovers,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’ll recover,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It’s so weird how time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The song therefore coalesces into a story of growing up, of how the solitude and sorrows of teenage years eventually fade as we learn to leave them behind. There’s a dual temporality to that final line, the teenage speaker projecting into the future and realizing that her current state will not be forever — despite what it seems in the moment — and that she will eventually move on, and her future-self reflecting backwards on how such an awful experience — one that changed her and plagued her — can then seem as if it happened centuries ago, to a completely different person. The final lines are well-placed as the last Emmy sings on &lt;em&gt;Edward&lt;/em&gt; because they truly epitomize the EP. These are songs and emotions Emmy wrote and felt long ago, and &lt;em&gt;Canopies and Drapes&lt;/em&gt; is able to, in equal parts, be a rumination on those emotions, while also nostalgically celebrating both their extremity and legitimacy, their place in her development as a woman and as a songwriter. The poignancy and power of &lt;em&gt;Edward&lt;/em&gt;, Emmy admits, reawakened her love for songwriting, an effect I can certainly rejoice about — because she’s damn good at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

      <title>Princess Bubblegum &amp; Marceline: Still Just Almost Girlfriends</title>

        &lt;p&gt;It’s only natural that the first post on my shiny new blog should be about these two, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this post by saying that I love Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and Bubbline and Sugarless Gum, all of that — whatever you’d like to call it, I ship it. Hard. I may not be a long-time &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; fan; I have not experienced firsthand the “What Was Missing” controversy, the joy delivered when &lt;em&gt;Sky Witch&lt;/em&gt; premiered, and so on. I jumped on-board late, binge-watched my way to this pairing, which washed over me with all its fluffy, tumultuous grace. I was vaguely aware that it was a popular ship as I made my way up to “What Was Missing”; I transcended as I witnessed Marceline’s impromptu, angst-ridden love ballad to Peebles; I immediately rewatched “Go With Me”, eager to see the pair’s first on-screen interaction; I stormed ahead to “Sky Witch”. I filled my tumblr with all the lovely fanart in existence for the couple, bemusing my followers who already taunted me for my FemShep/Liara obsession; I formed headcanons, all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that same vein, I would love to see the two become canon — not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; because I ship them as I do, but because representing bi or pan&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; people&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and relationships on television — &lt;em&gt;children’s&lt;/em&gt; television, no less! — is top priority here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being established, I think we need to rewind a little bit and go through the history (which, if you’re reading this post, probably isn’t any kind of news… but bear with me).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the première of &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/What_Was_Missing&#34; title=&#34;Episode synopsis&#34;&gt;“What Was Missing”&lt;/a&gt; — essentially, Bubbline gospel — a promotional video series titled &lt;em&gt;Mathematical!&lt;/em&gt; posted a recap of the episode, as they were wont to do. In it, they commented on the “possible subtext” within the episode, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://natazilla.tumblr.com/tagged/adventure+time&#34;&gt;some of Natasha Allegri’s more suggestive art&lt;/a&gt;. The video was pulled, &lt;em&gt;Mathematical!&lt;/em&gt; was discontinued, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20160413073842/http://danrickmers.com/post/10906625743/just-so-you-know-the-adventure-time-fandom-is&#34;&gt;Dan Rickmers lost his job&lt;/a&gt;. Since, “Sky Witch” and the &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; comics have tantalized fans waiting for the ship to become canon, but not much more. Oh, and Marceline made good on her promise to drink the red from Bubblegum’s “pretty pink face” in &lt;em&gt;Red Starved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back into the (almost) present, Olivia Olson — the voice actress for Marceline — appeared at a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble panel, where a fan asked her about the relationship between PB and the Vampire Queen…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Pendleton Ward] said “Oh, you know they dated right?” And I said “That’s what I figured from all the creepy fanart… are they going to do it on the show? Or can we say anything about it in the book?” and he’s like “I don’t know about the book but in some countries where the show airs that sort of thing is illegal,” so that’s why they’re not putting it in the show. So who knows, maybe there will be something about it in the new episodes that we’re not supposed to talk about…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EleCNWfwTY&#34;&gt;See the video here&lt;/a&gt;, which, as you might have guessed, was shared almost instantly. A day later, Olivia Olson tweeted:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like to make things up at panels. Ya’ll [sic] take my stories way too seriously…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tweet was subsequently deleted, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/adventuretime/comments/2d0ees/olivia_olson_addresses_the_reveal_at_the_book/cjktg8z&#34;&gt;is preserved by the TweetPoster bot on reddit&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds a lot like damage control, to me — if I had to guess, Olson was relaying genuine information, realized the video had blown up, attempted to cover up her tracks — albeit gracelessly — and then deleted the tweet for some reason (likely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it was so sloppy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Six days later, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/adventure-time-actor-confirms-princess-bubblegum-and-marceli&#34;&gt;Buzzfeed picked up the news&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/adventure-time-rumor_n_5681894.html&#34;&gt;HuffPo not long after that&lt;/a&gt;, both assuring readers that the couple was confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And don’t get me wrong — I’m thrilled. Absolutely jazzed, not just because this has given the Bubbline tag new life on tumblr (even if it’s just excited gifs from even more excited fans, which is precious in its own right). But we haven’t reached canon &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the very definition of canon is complex. One needs only scratch the surface of the multiple levels of canon within the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe to understand just how complicated it can be, but &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; canon strictly adheres to only the source material — that is, the _Adventure Time_show — and official, “word of God” statements (which a paraphrased account from a voice actress is not).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yo people need to quit saying that Bubbeline is canon because the Marceline voice actress said so. Unless it’s on the show it’s not canon!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It’s cute and sweet and she’s a delight but it isn’t canon&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I wish!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They won’t let me put it in the books&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventuretitan.tumblr.com/post/94857816987/this-is-kate-leths-response&#34;&gt;Kate Leth on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not harboring any delusions of Prubs and Marceline making out on-screen, of course — I acknowledge that this is a children’s show, though light kissing has become commonplace since Finn’s relationship with Flame Princess, and mature subject matter isn’t exactly excluded either. Until we have that in-show confirmation, though, I’m dubious about dubbing the two “canon.” I can’t blame those who do, though — with the extremely limited representation of queer romances in the media, and the few &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; shown often being problematic, fans have to take what they can get. It’s a time to celebrate, certainly. But we’re not out of the closet yet — and that’s not just my preferences on what is and isn’t canon speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given all the wonderful, beautiful qualities and nuances of the show, I have faith in them to do it. &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular children’s shows out there today because it doesn’t underestimate its audience; it doesn’t shy away from subject matter because it might be controversial or uncomfortable, even if often done allegorically (I’m looking at you, “Lemonhope”). I want the &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; crew, and Cartoon Network by extension, to have the bravery to stick their necks out and stand up for the cause of representation.  To have such a popular show openly come forward with two of its major characters in a bi/pan relationship would be earth-shattering. Little steps are great, but we should not satisfy ourselves with less than what the show is capable of and what fans — and children, and queer people, — &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear which. Many people — including myself, in the past — have labelled the two and/or the relationship as lesbian, incorrectly as both have dated or otherwise been romantically involved with men (Marceline with Ash, PB with Mr. Creampuff, Braco, and Finn, the latter two arguable). Furthermore, I think it would be most important to allow the characters — and therefore, the creators, — to choose whichever term they sexually identify with, if any. But I digress, and find bi or pan most accurate.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also they’re not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; people. One is made out of candy and the other is a demon/human/vampire hybrid.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;

      <p>I read a thread online recently about bisexuality: folks were discussing use of the label compared to something like pansexual. Many folks within the LGBTQ+ umbrella argue that pansexual is a more inclusive label than bisexual, as <em>bi-</em> upholds a binary view of gender.</p>
<p>My relationship with my bisexuality has been fraught. I can pinpoint in specificity where I feel it started: in the sixth grade (for me, 2005 or 2006), reading the sex ed chapter in my science textbook, I was presented with the three sexualities — heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. I had, by that point, already started puberty and experienced low-level attraction. I&rsquo;d been confused that that attraction never seemed to have a distinct target: I liked boys and I liked girls. I remember an immediate sense of comfort and belonging in the term. <em>That&rsquo;s allowed?</em>, I thought. Reading it in a textbook made it seem so simple. <em>Then surely that&rsquo;s the way to be.</em></p>
<p>Through the rest of middle and high school, I continued to experience attraction in this way, but the word suddenly felt more complicated. I lived in an extremely conservative town; there were only a handful of openly queer kids, and I was inundated with queerphobic messaging — that bisexuality was just a phase, that everyone is a little bicurious during puberty. I digested it and refused the label, even as friends privately insisted to me that being in love with Natalie Portman wasn&rsquo;t something straight women experienced.</p>
<p>This confusion and my (mostly unrelated) depression throughout high school made me uninterested in dating. When I finally graduated and moved on to college, the question became more pressing. I found myself seeking out spaces, both physically and digital, for queer people. My fleeting college friendships of the time were all with queer people. I found safety and comfort there, but I didn&rsquo;t know why — I continued to insist I was straight and merely engaging in feminist allyship.</p>
<p>The final breaking point was, I&rsquo;m a bit ashamed to say, watching an episode of <em>Adventure Time</em>. In &ldquo;What Was Missing,&rdquo; Marceline and Princess Bubblegum&rsquo;s past relationship becomes queer at least subtextually (but almost explicitly). I found myself crying, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure why; ruminating over it hours later, I realized what I was feeling was affirmation and euphoria. I returned back to the emotion I felt upon seeing the word <em>bisexual</em> in that textbook all those years ago, the simple acknowledgement and acceptance. It was the last time my sexuality made sense to me, and here again I felt that same emotion.</p>
<p>I finally accepted myself as bisexual from then on — I was 19 years old. I &ldquo;came out&rdquo; to a few online friends. but I felt some hang-ups identifying as such when I hadn&rsquo;t been with any women (or anyone at that point — at least in any real way). It didn&rsquo;t feel necessary to proclaim to the world just yet, but there was a solace in finally seeing myself as I am.</p>
<p>A few months later, I&rsquo;d meet my current partner, a cisgender man, and the label started to become more complicated. I wasn&rsquo;t sure I had any right to consider myself bisexual if I&rsquo;d never been with any women, and really, it wasn&rsquo;t something I had to think about all that often, being in a straight-presenting relationship.  I continued to experience attraction to women (within the bounds of a monogamous relationship), but it didn&rsquo;t feel all that important to me to define.</p>
<p>When I started my teaching job, I put a pride flag up in my room. I knew seeing it would matter to some kids, and I wanted my classroom to be an inclusive space. That snowballed into me starting the school&rsquo;s GSA because I was apparently the only teacher in the building who had shown any open support for the LGBTQ+ community and willingness to sign a name to it. I&rsquo;m not open about my bisexuality to my students or coworkers, however, because it simply doesn&rsquo;t feel relevant<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; and again, there was a guilt in being in a straight-passing relationship: I didn&rsquo;t need to tell anyone how I identified because I could hide under the guise of heterosexuality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had to be out or open because I haven&rsquo;t been in a relationship that requires it. I told a friend that I considered myself bisexual recently and shared some of the asterisks on that identity that I&rsquo;ve described here, adding that I really don&rsquo;t know what coming out looks like anymore in 2023<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But then, being around friends that I know <em>know</em> and being open about that part of my identity gives me that same comfort I felt in that textbook all those years ago.</p>
<p>So returning back to the word itself and whether it is or isn&rsquo;t inclusive: for me, there&rsquo;s a long history with the word <em>bisexual</em> that I can&rsquo;t erase. There&rsquo;s an attachment that I can&rsquo;t discount. I experience different attraction to different genders, which doesn&rsquo;t seem to gel with pansexuality to me. And perhaps the label shares somethings in common with the word biweekly; confusing, unclear, and in need of further explanation.</p>
<p>Consider this my explanation: it&rsquo;s about what it means to me, the spirit of the word if not the technical meaning.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not relevant to me outside of the club, I should say; I will tell the kids within the club because we have an established &ldquo;Vegas rule.&rdquo; Outside of that, it feels like personal, private business that isn&rsquo;t relevant to my teaching. As I&rsquo;ve said to coworkers who know, &ldquo;the kids don&rsquo;t need to know who I&rsquo;m fucking on the weekends.&rdquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

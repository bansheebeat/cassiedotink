      <description>&lt;p&gt;2016 was the first year I was eligible to vote in a presidential election. I was away at college, so I completed an absentee ballot, and, like most, felt confident in what I thought would be the result. I was no big fan of Clinton&amp;rsquo;s — I voted for Bernie in the primaries — but the other option was laughable: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that a major political party put such a clown up as their candidate, and I thought the electorate was smart enough to see him for the fraud (and fascist) he was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I downloaded &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Unbound&lt;/em&gt; the other day to play alongside my partner. We are both big &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans — like buy the new games every year fans — though my interest has waned over the last few years (I loved &lt;em&gt;Legends Arceus&lt;/em&gt; and generally felt that &lt;em&gt;Scarlet/Violet&lt;/em&gt; were slaps in the face&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). I have fond memories of the classic games, and I&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot of positive buzz about &lt;em&gt;Unbound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Top Ten Video Games from the 2010s</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another decade in the book, another opportunity to represent my life in lists and data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking retrospectively, this past decade defined my interest in games. It’s been a hobby of mine since I was a young child — I remember holing up in my mom’s basement, replaying the same minigames over and over in &lt;em&gt;Gus Goes to Cyberopolis&lt;/em&gt;. My dad bought me a Gameboy Color for my fifth birthday, and I dedicated at least a decade of my life (regrettably) to the &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; series. But in 2010, I started my first job, and so I finally had some disposable income to spend on my hobbies; I didn’t have to beg for games as birthday or Christmas or whenever presents. And so I played a lot more games in these past ten years. I started to follow industry news beyond new releases. I became more thoughtful about and critical of the industry. And I shifted my hobby into professional inquiry: in 2018, I co-wrote a book chapter about how video games could be used in educational settings, and in 2019, I piloted a camp that empowered kids to create their own video games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Life is Strange Episode 1: Chrysalis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; follows Max, the recently minted 18-year-old photography nerd, attending the elite Blackwall Academy. In the trend of episodic games, &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; centers around player choice, the butterfly effect being both a literal and figurative force in the game. It manages, however, to distinguish itself from not only Telltale Games — with its unique center and focus on two teenage girls, as well as its gorgeous, indie-film presentation — but also from just about everything else we’re seeing in gaming today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

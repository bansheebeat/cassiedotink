      <title>Using Hugo to generate a podcast feed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been podcasting on and off for over ten years now — all shows that I&amp;rsquo;ve since abandoned&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, either intentionally or due to time — but I&amp;rsquo;ve kept websites for them up and running for archival purposes. Originally, the sites were powered by WordPress and podcasting plugins (PowerPress and then Podlove). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to continue paying to host the sites nor maintain a WordPress install&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I could, of course, use one of the many podcast hosting services out there — but just like I believe in owning your own space on the internet, I believe you should own and control your podcast feed (and not have to pay a company $15/mo in perpetuity). I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; (which I then deploy with Cloudflare Pages) to generate the sites and feeds; I chose Hugo  because I understand how to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you could make this work with other static site generators. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://eleventy-plugin-podcaster.com/&#34;&gt;an 11ty plugin&lt;/a&gt; out there, for example, which is far more advanced than what I&amp;rsquo;ve set up. But I built this myself. It works. It does not require me to endlessly fiddle or update (unless I want to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>FX chains by the utterly inept</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time ago (and a time, and a time), I had a podcast. I miss podcasting dearly and think about going back often — otherwise, what am I to do with a partial, flawed understanding of normalizing to a target loudness and editing around the disgusting noises my mouth makes? Well, share it with others, of course.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case it was not clear, I am not a professional. I am a blockhead who likes to tinker and who has watched a lot of YouTube videos. These are the FX chains I use for my voice, which may or may not be helpful to other people who do not have my voice. This is also not an exhaustive audio guide or overview of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I edit my audio. Maybe another time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

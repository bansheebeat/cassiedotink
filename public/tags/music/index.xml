      <title>Moving from Plex to Navidrome for music</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started accumulating my music library in the mid-2000s by downloading shit off Limewire. At the time of writing, that library is approaching nearly 20,000 songs and around 200GB in size.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As a teen married to my computer, I used various apps to listen to and manage the library — iTunes so I could sync with my iPod Nano, Winamp when I wanted something local, and then eventually foobar2000 when Winamp went the way of the buffalo. Once the smartphone era came around, I used Google Play Music to upload the library to their servers , and that bridged the gap between my locally stored media and listening on the go from whatever device. Frankly, at the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that Google was allowing something like this — absolutely none of the music was purchased through them and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying a cent to access it. After a few years, Google shut down Play Music and attempted to transition everyone to YouTube Music. My response was a resounding &amp;ldquo;Fuck that,&amp;rdquo; and so I did what any normal person would do: I &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/moving-my-home-server-to-a-new-chassis/&#34;&gt;built a home server&lt;/a&gt; so that I could, essentially, host my own Spotify.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;@jamesmckz &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jamesmckz/status/1764778536244507081&#34;&gt;shared the following challenge on X&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No cheating - your Quietus style Bakers Dozen. 13 albums (off the top of your head) to know you by. Not looking for a perfect list, looking for a list that you instantly regret posting because you then remember something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I approached my response largely as a list of albums that have meant something to me in my life — not necessarily what I&amp;rsquo;m actively listening to at the moment. Many of these albums I&amp;rsquo;ve not listened to much in years, but I consider them pivotal, essential listening for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine is a big fan of Florence + the Machine. I confessed to only really knowing (but liking) her hits, &amp;ldquo;Dog Days&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Cosmic Love.&amp;rdquo; I asked which album she would recommend I listen to; she said &lt;em&gt;How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; (2015),&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I texted her about some of the songs on it. She asked if I was listening to the whole thing given the back to back messages; I said yes, and I started to consider &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I like to consume music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Here’s What I Was Listening to in 2020</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels like most of my blog posts end up being about music. I’d like to pretend that this post is a piece of an annual tradition in which I review and analyze my listening patterns from the past year, but truth be told, I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/heres-what-i-was-listening-to-in-2015/&#34;&gt;only done this once before, in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/my-top-ten-albums-from-the-2010s/&#34;&gt;kind of early in 2020, when I reviewed my favorite albums from the last ten years&lt;/a&gt;. Truth is, I’d like this to be a tradition, a habit I develop, but I’ve had about as much success with that as I have with my resolution to exercise more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Top Ten Albums from the 2010s</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That I’m a big ol’ music weirdo should come as no surprise to anyone who has read &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/heres-what-i-was-listening-to-in-2015/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/revolutions/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cassie.ink/canopies-and-drapes/&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; it. I have tracked just about all of my music listening to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.last.fm/user/wearebeautiful&#34;&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; since 2014, both to maintain a record and gather minute statistics about myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turned 16 in 2010, and my 25th birthday was this past November. The latter half of my adolescent identity formation therefore took place during this past decade, and the music I listened to during those years acted as a score, a signpost, a catharsis, a reflection. I’ve come to mark events in my life with the music I was listening to at the time. And having spent my teen years sitting in front of a computer listening to music at pretty much all times, I developed a pretty large collection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Here’s What I Was Listening to in 2015</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the year closes, naturally I must compile experiences and interests from the period into data and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe I’m not being quite that heartless, but last.fm sure makes it easy to indulge that desire. I scrobble (almost) all of my music to last.fm as I enjoy having a record of my listening habits for both reference and analysis. This year I finally found a solid app to do so from my phone, too, though my scrobbles lack what I listen to at work, which is a lot, as well as about half the year of listening on my phone. Therefore, as we head into 2016, I’d like to look back on what I listened to the most in 2015 (not necessarily my favorite releases from the year — my musical discovery process is best described as stumbling across things years after release).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The harrowing process of puberty hit me in 2005, around the midpoint between my 10th and 11th birthday. I blame whatever weird hormones we feed kids these days, and that I probably continue to consume today, for its early onset, or perhaps I can deflect the blame to my parents and chalk it up to genetics — but whichever way, suddenly I found hair creeping up where it had never been before, dried blood on bargain brand, butterfly-clad underwear. Under oversized tee shirts, burgeoning breasts lumped together, hardly noticeable, but they would surely be big one day, I told myself with equal parts dread and wonder — after all, I had already donned my first bra, one of the first in my class, but certainly not the first to worry whether these new marks of my sex would throw my jump shot, bar me from swimming pools for twelve weeks out of the year, and shepherd me into the “girl’s section” of clothing stores where I’d exchange cargo shorts and sneakers for dresses and romances. I’d worry about entering middle school, about finding my locker and my classrooms, about making friends and who my future self would be, whether she’d look anything like the girl I saw reflected in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Canopies and Drapes: Emmy the Great’s Twist on the Classic Breakup Song</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/canopies-and-drapes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the music industry, and in the folk genre particular, breakup songs are not exactly uncommon, and for every chart-topping artist crooning over the radio about the throes of love, there are thousands of disconsolate teens pouring over their guitars. For her 2009 &lt;em&gt;Edward&lt;/em&gt; EP, England-based singer-songwriter Emma-Lee Moss (stage name Emmy the Great) visits the genre herself; the four included songs are among Emmy’s earliest, though they contain her usual balance of charm and poignancy, more often than not accompanied only by an acoustic strum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

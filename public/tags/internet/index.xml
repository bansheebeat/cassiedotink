      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automattic &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/07/automattic-launches-ai-writing-tool-that-aims-to-make-wordpress-blogs-more-readable-and-succinct/&#34;&gt;recently launched their Write Brief AI assistant&lt;/a&gt; for folks using Jetpack with WordPress.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is automatically available to anyone using wordpress.com, which I verified by logging into my 14-year-old account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to test it out on my recent post about &lt;em&gt;The Basic Eight&lt;/em&gt;. I chose this because it&amp;rsquo;s one of my more recent posts that isn&amp;rsquo;t #week-notes . I pasted it directly into the Gutenberg editor with all of the AI settings toggled on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a New Years Resolution person; listening to a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/track/my-year-in-lists-2&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;My Year in Lists&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Los Campesinos! as a teen made me quite cynical about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; a very goal-oriented, reflective person. In late 2022, after years of gaining weight and developing some really negative patterns of self-talk around my body image, I decided to join a gym. Of course I&amp;rsquo;d like to see the number on the scale go down, but the main goal was just to get healthier and develop healthier habits. I started running, because that&amp;rsquo;s what I used to do (not well), and eventually convinced a friend to join with me. Together, we set the goal of running a 5K, and we did our first in May of 2023, in about 41 minutes (in our defense, it was an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; hilly course, but also progress, progress&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). We ran three more as the year went by; my most recent was November, where I finished in around 36 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Old Woman Yells at the Cloud</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently listened to an episode of &lt;em&gt;Never Been a Better Podcast&lt;/em&gt; in which Austin Walker, referencing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/v21/status/1490297801569353729&#34;&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by @v21, posited that we are moving into a new era of the internet where content is generated by machines rather than people; where once the internet was used by people to access large bodies of information and to connect with &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people, we now use it to connect with machines that regurgitate photocopies of photocopies of information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

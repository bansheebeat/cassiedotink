All I really want to do is be alone in my house, left to do my silly little projects. I&rsquo;m trying still to move away from big, corporate social media — I have been spending more time on Mastodon and the bearblog discover feed.

I rarely hit it for either, but something about knowing the timer is there makes me more conscious of the time I&rsquo;m wasting on them.

On Friday, I went to IKEA with a friend and my sister to get some things for the house and a few items for my classroom. I intended to go into school on Saturday and begin some of the physical setup I need to do, but I felt sick and exhausted.

      <h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>Joe and I visited some of his family with a lake house this week where my farmer&rsquo;s tan became more and more pronounced. I also &ldquo;worked&rdquo; two days this week: I had committee meetings on Thursday and then a joint meeting to coordinate middle school/high school/college GSAs in my area.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I finished reading <em>Return of the King</em> this week, completing a long-standing personal mission to read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. I <a href="https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie/cassiedotink.git">wrote up a big long post</a> with my history with the series and my thoughts.</p>
<p>Originally, I planned to read <em>Perdido Street Station</em> by China Miéville next, but I wanted something breezy after the <em>RotK</em> gauntlet, so I picked up <em>Ghost Boys</em> by Jewell Parker Rhodes and burned through it in a day. It was amazing. I&rsquo;m adjuncting at my local college in the fall — it&rsquo;s a course for future English teachers about young adult literature. I&rsquo;m considering offering students a choice of this or <em>All American Boys</em>. Both deal with a similar subject matter, but <em>Ghost Boys</em> is better suited for middle school. I&rsquo;d love to teach the book to my middle schoolers, too, but I think that will be an uphill battle&hellip;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My next read is <em>Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist</em> by Liz Pelly. I&rsquo;m about 100 pages in and really enjoying it — I&rsquo;m not usually one for non-fiction, but I also am a noted Spotify hater (and have been for a long time), so this felt like a good way to dip my toe in. Highly recommend!</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been rewatching <em>Downton Abbey</em>. I&rsquo;m in season two right now; I&rsquo;m debating whether to finish the series (I never watched past season five, I think) or if I&rsquo;ll stop when they kill off some major characters in season three. I am glad to confirm that I was always right: Mary is the main character and the best character. I am noticing more and more the ridiculous plotlines, however — I maintained for years that seasons one and two were actually good and after that it descended into soap opera melodrama, but I am older and wiser now. I think I&rsquo;d still recommend the first season, but stop there.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of <strong>Rainbow Kitten Surprise</strong> lately as a lead up to seeing them in concert. I really enjoy them — when I last mentioned them, I think I&rsquo;d only listened to <em>RKS</em>, on a friend&rsquo;s recommendation; I&rsquo;ve since rounded out their discography. Here is my slipshod and unscientific personal ranking of their discography:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>RKS</em> - their best and most consistent; this is an <em>album</em>, an entire vibe, worth listening through in one sitting. Listen to &ldquo;Cold Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wasted.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Seven + Mary</em> - a rough sketch of what they would eventually realize on <em>RKS,</em> but I like it — I think I have a lot of 2013 nostalgia. Listen to &ldquo;First Class&rdquo; and &ldquo;American Hero.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>How to: Friend, Love, Freefall</em> - Great moments and some real stand out tracks, but it gets too same-y for me in places. Listen to &ldquo;Moody Orange&rdquo; (maybe my favorite song by them) and &ldquo;Fever Pitch&rdquo; (add in &ldquo;Possum Queen&rdquo; if you want a weird one that will stick in your head)</li>
<li><em>Love Hate Music Box</em> - I&rsquo;ve had a lot of ups and downs with this one: I think it has too many songs and the good ones maybe didn&rsquo;t get to bake long enough. But the more I sit with it and take the songs as they are, the more I like it. Listen to &ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sickset.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>I also, for some reason, thought about the band <strong>The Madrigals</strong> for the first time in a long time, which I&rsquo;m sure I discovered on MySpace or last.fm or some other defunct platform. There&rsquo;s very little remaining about them online, but I have a few MP3s of theirs that I probably downloaded from one of the aforementioned sites. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://dandelionradio.com/tracklists/2008-04/index.htm">cool as fuck old radio archive website that mentions them</a> (and has a radio show with one of their songs still archived!), and I  <a href="http://thestreetlampdoesntcast.blogspot.com/2011/02/griff-says-land-ahoy-its-columbus.html">stumbled on a music blog from 2011</a> that mentioned some of the members&rsquo; later bands, which led to me downloading <a href="https://upsettherhythm.bandcamp.com/album/horizon"><em>Horizon</em> by <strong>Trash Kit</strong></a>. I haven&rsquo;t sat down to give it a good listen yet, but I will.</p>
<p>I listened through to <a href="https://beingdead.bandcamp.com/album/eels"><em>EELS</em> by <strong>Being Dead</strong></a> as well, which is a real rad vibe all throughout. &ldquo;Love Machine&rdquo; might be my favorite song I&rsquo;ve heard this year; &ldquo;Van Goes&rdquo; also has big &ldquo;Bela Lugosi&rsquo;s Dead&rdquo; vibes.</p>

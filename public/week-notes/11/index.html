PlayingJoe and I have played more of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, which is really him watching me play and selecting dialogue options with me. He really does not care for the combat; I don&rsquo;t love it either, but having played so much of this game and the first as a kid, I know my way around it much better. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to like any of the characters yet; on one hand, I get that, because I think the KotOR II characters are much more complex and harder to initially like than the first game&rsquo;s, but maybe the series just isn&rsquo;t for him&hellip; We&rsquo;ve been playing as a female Exile, but Joe was interested in the Handmaiden, and I prefer her to the Disciple, so I decided to roll back a save and use the PartySwap mod&hellip; until I realized that I have Steam Workshop mods mixed with the KotOR II Mod Build.2 Apparently, because I used the Workshop 13 years ago when I last played this game, Steam decided I definitely wanted those installed again. Ugh. The solution was to start from the beginning with cheats that will let me zip through and get back to where we were. It took the better part of five hours to re-install all the mods and play back through Peragus and Telos. That all said, I really love this game. I love the way the narrative places you in a backstory rather than the &ldquo;blank slate&rdquo; approach of the first game.3 The player then gets to decide the Exile&rsquo;s reasons for going to war, their outlook on the Jedi, and there&rsquo;s a lot of gray area to be found. ListeningMr. Anyway’s Holey Spirits Perform! One Foot in Bethlehem and Pure Particles by The Bug Club. More recommendations from a former student of mine. I&rsquo;m really enjoying them! One Foot in Bethlehem very clearly has some religious satire, but I&rsquo;ve not had a chance to parse for sub-text&hellip; At this point, I&rsquo;m on a basal, what&rsquo;s catchy level (the answer is a lot). religion, marriage, the future&hellip; the usual, at this point.

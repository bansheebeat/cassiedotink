      <p>First up, a small update to my week notes format: I&rsquo;m going to try to include a cover image with each post as a further homage to <em>Never Hungover Again</em> (from which I shamelessly stole the design of my site). I&rsquo;d like to make it a random picture from the week. I&rsquo;m hoping this will encourage me to take more pictures, perhaps even using the fancy camera that I paid several hundred dollars for and never touch. I took this week&rsquo;s picture in the bathroom of a winery (omitted snapchat caption: &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t considering it but thanks for the heads up i guess&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>I taught my first college class! It went far better than I anticipated; by about half an hour in, I fell into my natural teacher mode and it was smooth sailing from there. I&rsquo;m excited to work with the kids<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and see how I do throughout the semester. I still have deep-seated imposter syndrome about teaching (<em>adjunct lecturing</em>) the course on a macro-level, but the day-by-day is at least seeming more feasible.</p>
<p>For context,  the college I&rsquo;m teaching (<em>adjunct lecturing</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) at is my alma mater. I transferred there as a junior from community college, and this course is the first one I took there — with a professor who went on to become a mentor and a personal friend. She scared the shit out of me then (she still does) because she is <em>so good</em> at what she does, so experienced, and (seemingly) effortlessly incredible as a teacher. The idea that I have to, in some way, fill her shoes — teach her class, in the same room I took it, nine years later — is absolutely terrifying. Who am I to tell these kids how to teach?? I have very lovely friends who have talked me up and assured me that I&rsquo;ll do a great job, but I think I&rsquo;ll never be able to shake the feeling that I&rsquo;m not doing what she would have (or not doing as good as her). Of course that&rsquo;s ridiculous and I need to be my own person, and it is within this contradiction that I must exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to my classroom a few times this week getting some of the bigger projects done. I&rsquo;ll have time to put on finishing touches on the teacher conference days next week, but I&rsquo;d rather cut open 96 tennis balls at a relaxed pace than rush to do it the day before kids show up. I&rsquo;ve also been spending time helping Joe get his together, too.</p>
<p>Site-wise, I&rsquo;m continuing to backport content from an old blog. This week I&rsquo;ve added&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Joe and I are done with <em>Survivor: Caramoan</em> and have now moved on to <em>Blood vs. Water</em>, a season I am very fond of.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p>I played some more of <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3</em>. I finally decided to install some mods so that I can just finish the game. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12023">Cheaters Spell Scroll</a> to basically pass all of my dice checks and then something to increase my carry capacity. Nothing game-breaking necessarily since I was already save-scumming every roll — instead, hopefully, I&rsquo;m just saving myself <em>time</em>. It took a while to figure out how to make the mods work,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> mostly because the developer of the (good, but esoteric and inscrutable) mod manager has no publicly accessible documentation or help; it&rsquo;s all in a fucking Discord server.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m focusing not so much on exploring Baldur&rsquo;s Gate the city naturally and rather just mainlining toward my quest markers on the map. I believe I&rsquo;ve wrapped up Gale&rsquo;s quest as far as I can until much later in the game — why I chose to start with his, I&rsquo;m not sure. Proximity, I guess. I did however encounter a friend of Karlach&rsquo;s (with Karlach in the party), who asked if Karlach and I were an item. Karlach responded with <a href="https://youtu.be/vsPvlDl5ksg?si=9sZA_GX3z5ykGiXg&amp;t=16">something along the lines of &ldquo;gross.&rdquo;</a> Salt in the wound etc. I finished the Auntie Ethel plotline and picked up Minsc; I&rsquo;m starting to feel better about the game — things are much smoother when I&rsquo;m passing most every dice roll. Importantly, this is only on my character, so while she has a bit of an advantage on attacks in battle (nothing crazy though because she&rsquo;s mainly a healer), there&rsquo;s still a challenge. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m back to my Act I adulation, but I&rsquo;m at least feeling more motivated to finish.</p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I did a <em>lot</em> of podcast listening this week! Cleaning and organizing my classroom has been a good opportunity for it because it&rsquo;s mostly mindless labor. I&rsquo;ve been digging through Into the Aether&rsquo;s <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> episodes (<a href="https://pca.st/ryz2z5wd">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep | Bonus</a> and <a href="https://pca.st/m4xgagit">I Norted Myself</a>) plus the <a href="https://pca.st/Kj2p">Song Exploder episode on &ldquo;Miasma Sky.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://thebugclub.bandcamp.com/album/pure-particles"><em>Pure Particles</em> by The Bug Club</a>. It has some of my favorite songs of theirs (&ldquo;If My Mother Thinks I&rsquo;m Happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pure Particles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Love Song,&rdquo; primarily). I haven&rsquo;t been quite as enthused with their more recent releases — <em>Very Human Features</em> was good, and I didn&rsquo;t really care about <em>On the Intricate Inner Workings of the System</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> — but <em>Pure Particles</em> through <em>Rare Birds</em> is such an incredible run of quality.</p>
<p>As part of my mission to upgrade the low quality MP3s I have on my music server, I ordered and ripped a few CDs this week: Johnny Flynn&rsquo;s <em>A Larum</em>, Mirah&rsquo;s <em>C&rsquo;mon Miracle</em>, and Freelance Whales&rsquo;s <em>Weathervanes</em>. I was really only looking for <em>A Larum</em> specifically, but the seller on discogs had a shipping minimum. The others were on my list and the seller happened to have them available. It&rsquo;s a little funny — I was listening to these albums all at a specific point in my life (specifically <em>C&rsquo;mon Miracle</em> and <em>Weathervanes</em> when I was horrifically depressed in my late teens; Johnny Flynn was a bit earlier).</p>
<p>That nostalgia (if you can call it that — is there a nostalgia that&rsquo;s for <em>bad</em> memories?<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>) brought me back to <a href="https://aveytare.bandcamp.com/album/pullhair-rubeye"><em>Pullhair Rubeye</em> by Avey Tare &amp; Kría Brekkan</a>, an odd album that was released in reverse. The reversed version (so the normal one) of &ldquo;Lay Lay Off, Faselam&rdquo; is an all-timer for me; I was listening to it a lot in 2012. Releasing the album in reverse was, apparently, a controversial move, but I like it both ways — and I finally took the time to actually reverse it myself.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Then I listened to <a href="https://trustfund.bandcamp.com/album/dont-let-them-begin-ep"><em>Don&rsquo;t Let Them Begin</em> by Trust Fund</a> because I had &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll Both Apologize&rdquo; stuck in my head (🎶 <em>I&rsquo;m alone in the house and I&rsquo;m freaking myself out again, I&rsquo;m clapping my hands and spinning my arms around</em> 🎶). It&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found myself referring to the students as &ldquo;kids.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re juniors and seniors in college, so probably at most around ten years younger than me. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a speech pattern picked up from teaching middle schoolers, who I can safely call kids, or if I&rsquo;m an old lady now.

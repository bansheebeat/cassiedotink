      <h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>My desk upgrade journey hasn&rsquo;t gone as planned. The monitor mount I bought has a really small clamp, which I should have checked before buying it, but I was so excited about a good deal. It fits on the desk and looks great, but I&rsquo;m not able to spread the weight with the steel plates I bought, and I don&rsquo;t trust a particleboard desktop to stand the test of time with a clamp. I spent a long time trying to brainstorm solutions (modify the clamp? build a wooden desk top?), and I had a sleepless night stressed about it. Eventually I decided to just order a different mount and I&rsquo;ll try to sell this one locally to get my money back. It&rsquo;s a bummer because the arm is <em>really</em> nice, but I wanted the piece of mind of using something that isn&rsquo;t jerry-rigged. Normally I&rsquo;m down for a stupid solution, but not when it&rsquo;s holding up several hundreds of dollars of tech.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I went to a PD on <em>The Writing Revolution,</em> which was more of an excuse for me to hang with some colleagues that I like, and I finally finished the syllabus for the college course I&rsquo;m teaching in a week or so. Joe and I then spent the weekend visiting some friends. It really feels like summer is winding down; I can see the start of the school year rush kicking up.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in the middle of <em>All Boys Aren&rsquo;t Blue,</em> but I focused on finishing my syllabus instead of finishing the book this week.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Joe and I (re)watched <em>Sky High</em>. It was on Disney Channel constantly when we were kids. I am proud to say that the movie still rocks. When visiting friends, we also watched <em>Cars</em>, which I had somehow never seen. I liked it more than I expected to, though I thought some of the messaging was confused — don&rsquo;t give me a diatribe about the road going &ldquo;with&rdquo; the land and driving for enjoyment when cars are one of the greatest environmental blights in our society.</p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I finally got around to listening to <em>SOPHIE</em> by SOPHIE. Man, I have such mixed feelings about posthumous releases. The greedy bitch in me wants more, always, especially from artists who died way too young. I know SOPHIE&rsquo;s brother, who finished the album, insists that SOPHIE was nearly done with it at the time of her death, but the stretch between &ldquo;nearly finished&rdquo; and &ldquo;actually ready to release&rdquo; can be miles long for an artist. I&rsquo;m not an artist, by any means, of SOPHIE&rsquo;s caliber, but a piece of writing for me can completely transform in the edit. Posthumous albums too often feel like an early sketch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, a pastiche of the auteur that are perhaps categorically incapable of capturing the genuine vision and artistry of the deceased. Unfortunately, this was the case for me with <em>SOPHIE</em>: &ldquo;Reason Why&rdquo; and &ldquo;Live in My Truth&rdquo; were standouts, but in general, it lacked the thrill and voice of SOPHIE (RIP).</p>
<p>I downloaded <a href="https://muizyu.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-or-something-to-die-for"><em>nothing or something to die for</em> by mui zyu</a>. I had high hopes because I really like &ldquo;donna like parasites&rdquo; (I got a version of it in <a href="https://fatherdaughterrecords.com/products/its-2025-and-wow-thats-unfortunate-but-well-get-thru-this-with-a-free-sampler-so-here-ya-go">a free sample pack from the label</a>), but I found the album as a whole to be rather dull. &ldquo;donna&rdquo; was my only standout. zyu did put out <a href="https://muizyu.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-or-something-to-die-for-cantonese-tasting-menu">a collection with a few of the songs translated into Cantonese</a>, which features Emmy the Great (who I like) — a really cool idea that would be more novel if I was into the original tracks.</p>
<p>I shifted to Joanna Newsom&rsquo;s earliest release, <em>Walnut Whales</em>; it&rsquo;s a rough sketch of songs that would be realized later, but there&rsquo;s something really interesting about them — I think I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtRoOGYTGJc">&ldquo;Peach, Plumb, Pear&rdquo;</a> better than <a href="https://joannanewsom.bandcamp.com/album/the-milk-eyed-mender">the one that eventually appeared on <em>Milk-Eyed Mender</em></a> (which is, of course, iconic and still wonderful, but I love a synth). I really love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOACtsrSsgo">&ldquo;Erin&rdquo;</a> too, which never saw a re-recording outside of <em>Walnut Whales</em>. I listened to a bunch of <em>Ys</em> this week as well; it remains one of my favorite albums.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still super into <em>I Love My Computer</em> by Ninajirachi. Brendon Bigley <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/a-good-album-i-love-my-computer-by-ninajirachi">wrote a great review of it</a> on Wavelengths.</p>
<p>I chatted with my sister about music a bit and we reminisced about Paramore — we were huge fans as teens as soon as <em>All We Know Is Falling&hellip;</em> dropped. For some nostalgia, I went to listen through to the album again and do a little song-by-song write up, but only got through a few tracks. Maybe I&rsquo;ll pick it up on my next week notes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All We Know</strong> - Fine; a heavy track (by Paramore standards) that sets the tone for the album but is otherwise not super notable</li>
<li><strong>Pressure</strong> - iconic and excellent still. If I was trying to expose someone to the early pop-punk/emo scene, this is one of the first tracks I&rsquo;d play them. Special shoutout to the version of the song that was on <em>The Sims</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency</strong> - I also still really like this song. Josh Farro is an ass but the guitar on this song smashes.</li>
<li><strong>Brighter</strong> - I recall being a diehard for this song as a teen; today, I find it a little fatiguing to listen to. That might be in the mix, and I really like the outro still, but it&rsquo;s a notable downturn after the Pressure-Emergency one-two.</li>
<li><strong>Here We Go Again</strong> - This one feels like a bit of a recall of the band&rsquo;s funk roots. I still really love this song. I remember being a fan of an acoustic live performance someone had put on YouTube. Farro really did have an ear for a catchy guitar hook.</li>
</ol>
<p>As part of trying to get back into listening to podcasts, too, I listened to Cyberpunk 2077 from <a href="https://rss.com/podcasts/bgm-gems-pod">BGM Gems</a> - a little challenging to listen to because I&rsquo;ve never played Cyberpunk nor listened to the soundtrack, but I really appreciate the conversations, and I think highlighting music in games and using it as a lens to discuss them is a rad concept for a show. Excited to hear more!</p>

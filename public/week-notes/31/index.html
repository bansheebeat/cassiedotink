      <h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve backported the last of the posts from my old blog! These two were the most involved because they were long and involved creating some new shortcodes (particularly the games one).</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve therefore cancelled my Digital Ocean droplet<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and can stop worrying about keeping a WordPress install up to date. All links to bansheebeat.org should now redirect here.

<p>Otherwise, school started back up this week, so that&rsquo;s been consuming my time. We&rsquo;re only doing operations and procedures right now, but so far, things are going alright. I&rsquo;m optimistic it&rsquo;ll stay that way. I&rsquo;ve taken a step back from some of my committees and other obligations because I&rsquo;m adjuncting this semester. Despite the first day of school craze, it&rsquo;s odd how <em>relaxed</em> everything feels without the extra responsibilities that I typically heap upon myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m typing these notes hastily on Sunday night as I wasn&rsquo;t good about assembling them through the week. I have this odd sensation that I had some kind of monumental accomplishment or life event occur this week, but I can&rsquo;t remember what it was. I&rsquo;ll settle for believing that it&rsquo;s some kind of illusion, as I&rsquo;d remember anything as important. Or, perhaps, it can be held for next week.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Joe and I finished watching <em>Survivor: Blood vs. Water</em>. We burned through <em>Millennials vs. Gen X</em> after that and are now on <em>Cagayan</em>. I like <em>Cagayan</em> less than I remember it, but it&rsquo;s important to watch for other seasons.</p>
<p>At Joe&rsquo;s behest, we also watched <em>Unbreakable</em> (2000). <a href="https://mediaclub.plus/">Media Club Plus</a> is apparently covering all of the M. Night Shyamalan movies; Joe wants to listen, but he&rsquo;s never seen any of the films. He watched <em>Sixth Sense</em> alone (I&rsquo;d already seen it years ago and remember liking it), but he roped me into <em>Unbreakable</em>, which I watched without knowing anything about. I think it was some of the worst bullshit I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and I&rsquo;ve informed him that he will be watching all the rest of the movies on his own. Somehow, <em>Unbreakable</em> is considered one of Shyamalan&rsquo;s best movies (behind <em>Sixth Sense</em>, obviously). If that&rsquo;s the best, I have no interest in putting myself through any more.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p>A student taught me to play Gin, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure she was mixed up on the rules. I promised to study up for homework so that we can have a rematch.</p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to a lot of Trust Fund lately — I&rsquo;ve listened to <em>songs</em> of theirs for years but never really full albums. I went through all of <em>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s coming for us&rdquo;</em> (listen to &ldquo;Sadness,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cut me out,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unwieldy Foam&rdquo;), and I&rsquo;ve kept on with <em>Don&rsquo;t Let Them Begin</em> from last week (really feeling &ldquo;The Coolest Guy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seance&rdquo;). There&rsquo;s a kind of mopey indie slacker rock vibe to a lot of these, which I suppose reflects how I&rsquo;m feeling now.</p>
<p>I listened to <a href="https://thebethsnz.bandcamp.com/album/straight-line-was-a-lie"><em>Straight Line Was a Lie</em> by The Beths</a> (and bought it on Bandcamp Friday). It was OK — I loved &ldquo;No Joy,&rdquo; but I found the rest unremarkable.</p>

<p><em>Kept</em> definitely benefited from recency bias; I was super into it when I wrote this post. I&rsquo;d move <em>Swimming</em> up higher on the list today, but I think the intention of the post is to capture how I felt in that moment of time — not necessarily to create a perennial representation of my tastes.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Something with music would be fitting. Maybe if I spin off a section of this site for album ratings? I&rsquo;ve always wanted to start a database to track my listening&hellip; but I&rsquo;d also rather have everything on one domain.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

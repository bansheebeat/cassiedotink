      <p>I missed a week, so consider this two weeks of week notes.</p>
<h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>I was dead sick this week; I missed three days of work to some kind of upper respiratory illness that&rsquo;s going around the school. I haven&rsquo;t been sick in months, so maybe that&rsquo;s a part of it, but this genuinely kicked me on my ass, and my mom ingrained workaholic tendencies in me so severe that I feel guilty taking sick days. Alas, I am continuously humbled by the reality of existing in a human body.</p>
<p>That sickness (and catching up on everything I missed in three days out) consumed the majority of my time and focus through the week. I did however finally buy a basketball, which is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing for a while now. I played a lot as a kid and had an urge to get back into playing. I&rsquo;m consistently running in a nearby park with a friend on Sunday mornings, and I am thinking of shooting some hoops afterward. I gave that its first test today and played for nearly two hours with my running buddy&rsquo;s daughter. I am unfortunately quite bad, but for my first time holding a ball in 20 years, I&rsquo;m content to accept that I&rsquo;m simply out of practice.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Last week I fretted about my glasses. I am here to report that they do actually really help — especially for working on the computer — but that I am still a big baby about them.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading <em>Accountable: The True Story of a Racist Social Media Account and the Teenagers Whose Lives It Changed</em> by Dashka Slater for a school book club. I&rsquo;m about halfway through and enjoying it; it&rsquo;s a pretty quick, easy read, but it&rsquo;s highly relevant to our students today.</p>
<p>For personal reading, I&rsquo;ve picked <em>Villette</em> by Charlotte Brontë back up. I started from the beginning (I made it maybe 20 pages in last time) and am now about 75 pages deep. I think the very beginning in Bretton was hard to trudge through, but Lucy has now arrived in Villette and there&rsquo;s more promise there.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>In my sickness, I burned through the remainder of <em>Downton Abbey</em>. I enjoyed the last season or two more than I expected and am glad to have finally finished the show. I watched the entire first movie and a chunk of the second; I found them awful and do not intend to finish them unless I am quite desperate.</p>
<p>After quitting <em>Downton Abbey</em>, I was somehow struck with the urge to rewatch <em>Weeds</em> for maybe the fourth time. I&rsquo;m in the third season right now and enjoying it, but I recall everything after season three being bad. I still find Andy and Doug insufferable and deeply problematic, but I adore Mary Louise Parker&rsquo;s portrayal of Nancy and watching her descent into megalomania.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p>Joe has started playing <em>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</em> with me watching. I have a lot of fondness for the game (and history that I&rsquo;ve mostly made my peace with). I haven&rsquo;t touched <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3</em> in a few weeks now, which is equal parts being busy with school and not feeling compelled to go back to it. I would like to finish it, but I&rsquo;m excited for (and preordered) the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster that releases in a few days.</p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>A student told me to listen to Tyler The Creator. I&rsquo;ve never listened to his music in any substantial capacity but have always felt I&rsquo;ve known enough through word of mouth to know I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy him. Still, I emotionally blackmailed myself into believing that I needed to honor my students&rsquo; voices and listened through to <em>Call Me If You Get Lost</em>. I did not hate it as I expected but also feel no need to listen to any of it ever again. &ldquo;Wilshire&rdquo; was the only track I found somewhat compelling.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s been mostly shuffles for me. I briefly reawakened my &ldquo;Moody Orange&rdquo; hyperfixation and am determined to learn all of the lyrics (I&rsquo;m close!), but I haven&rsquo;t been able to find much time for music lately with the hubbub of school.</p>

      <h1 id="doing">Doing</h1>
<p>We had an unexpected snow day on Tuesday and then Wednesday off for Lunar New Year, which was a welcomed opportunity to relax at home. I played a lot of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> and did some upgrades to the computers in my house — all three (my PC, Joe&rsquo;s, and one hooked up to our TV) are AM4 builds, so I&rsquo;m able to upgrade my PC and put the old parts into the others. We&rsquo;re also planning and ordering equipment for our next big home project: wiring the living room and office with Cat6 ethernet and running down to a managed switch on the network rack. We made all of the purchases this week and plan to do the work over our February break.</p>
<p>Joe and I had a talk about something I&rsquo;ve been rolling around in my head a lot lately — my inability to shut my brain off and enjoy things, my refusal to ever just commit to the moment. It&rsquo;s maybe a topic for a longer post.</p>
<p>I finally deleted my twitter account, which dates back to probably 2011 or 2012. I stopped using it in favor of Mastodon and Bluesky a long time ago, but I dragged my feet about actually pulling the trigger. I&rsquo;m finally done. Elon Musk is a Nazi and I don&rsquo;t fuck with that. I could delete Facebook without another thought, but I have a few friends who use Instagram <em>only</em> that I want to keep up with. With time, maybe, but this is a step in the right direction for now.</p>
<h1 id="reading">Reading</h1>
<p>I have not touched <em>Villette</em> since reading the first twenty pages. Maybe back to back 19th century lit wasn&rsquo;t a good idea?</p>
<h1 id="watching">Watching</h1>
<p>I finished <em>Euphoria</em>. I think I really liked it? Season two went some bad (as in, poorly written and plotted) places, but so did season one I think — the first season was just a lot tighter and more cohesive. I&rsquo;ve read some about the behind the scenes drama with the show, which sours me — the creator seems like a dick. Jules remains my favorite, and I&rsquo;m interested to see where season three goes if it ever actually gets made.</p>
<p>Joe and I have been watching <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PsjZ6qakyJY">Vinny and Abby play <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em> on Nextlander</a>. It seems like a neat game that I&rsquo;d really enjoy playing, but I love Vinny and Abby&rsquo;s dynamic too much to not watch it — and I think I&rsquo;d need time to forget everything before I play it myself. The streams make me miss the golden days of Giant Bomb East&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been watching (with Joe on and off) <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe_AuQUfBKl6qEwkoLSlUXSCskcMEOKt0">Into the Aether&rsquo;s short-lived <em>Final Fantasy X</em> playthrough</a>. It&rsquo;s reawakening my love for that game; I think I have convinced Joe to play through it with me.</p>
<h1 id="playing">Playing</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to enjoy <em>Fields of Mistria</em>. I&rsquo;ve reached mid-fall and the bottom of the mines (for now). It might become a game I check in on when new updates come out, but I think what&rsquo;s here is really, really amazing.</p>
<h1 id="listening">Listening</h1>
<p>I listened to <em>10000 gecs</em> after really liking <em>1000 gecs</em>. It was a disappointment personally; I admire experimentation and innovation, but it didn&rsquo;t hit for me. It strayed too far from the goofy hyperpop that they did so well on <em>1000 gecs</em>; it was too much of a genre mishmash that leaned too hard into absurdism for the sake of comedy.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, who <a href="https://nkbradio.bandcamp.com/album/another-summer">made their own really sick hyperpop album</a>, recommended that I check out <a href="https://underscores.bandcamp.com/album/fishmonger"><em>fishmonger</em> by underscores</a>. I loved it. Maybe a perfect album.</p>

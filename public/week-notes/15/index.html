  <meta name="description" content="Doing Joe and I ran a Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving morning. My time was not good (40:38), but there was wet, heavy snow coming down, so I was mostly focused on not eating shit. I think mid-November might be my 5K cutoff.

With the holiday season upon us, this is usually around the time that I take a big trip out to a nearby mall to get gifts for everyone. I want to commit this year to shopping mostly (entirely?) from local small businesses or buying handmade and secondhand goods.

I&rsquo;ve run a few podcasts over the years, which all petered out for various reasons, but I&rsquo;m feeling the itch again. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d podcast about, though, which runs contrary to popular logic: you should have something to say, not just the desire to say things. I love audio production and the sound of my own voice, though. Maybe I record audio versions of my blog posts and turn that into a podcast? I want to write more, after all. I don&rsquo;t think my week notes would be conducive to an audio format, but maybe my longer form writing (what little of it exists). I bought a camera (Panasonic Lumix G7) on a bit of a whim. I film a lot of videos for my school, so I guess there&rsquo;s professional utility in using something other than my phone, but I also want to get better about taking pictures to preserve memories. Watching On Saturday, I felt sick and rotted on the couch and watched YouTube junkfood: mostly outsidexbox&rsquo;s seven things videos and Macho Nacho console mod videos. I don&rsquo;t mod consoles. I like to tinker with electronics, but I&rsquo;ve never soldered anything. Somehow, however, I find myself watching a lot of these sorts of videos. I think I admire the production value and Tito&rsquo;s calm, measured approach. I&rsquo;m about done with Daria, but I haven&rsquo;t watched the movies yet. Reading Into the Wild by John Krakauer. As a kid, the film adaptation was on frequent rotation in my house; my mom often fixated on one movie and watched it over and over, and she was a big fan of the soundtrack as well. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to read the book since, and I&rsquo;m trying again to commit to reading more now that the start of school year frenzy has died down for me. I&rsquo;m enjoying following McCandless&rsquo;s story and don&rsquo;t think Krakauer too effusive (though his biases are clear), but some of the tangents feel extraneous. Finished on November 28. A humanizing and sympathetic account of a controversial figure. A few meandering chapters, but there are — in McCandless&rsquo;s case especially — wrong turns taken in pursuit of truth, meaning, and beauty. I&rsquo;ve ordered Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s Villette through my local bookstore as an upcoming read on the recommendation of a student&rsquo;s parent. I&rsquo;m also interested in getting my hands on The Dead Father by David Barthelme after reading an excerpt in Into the Wild. Playing Satisfactory. Just a few months before the pandemic, while I was in grad school, I fell deeply in love with Satisfactory and attempted in vain to explain to my literary and well-rounded colleagues that I was spending my free time balancing my iron production pipelines and converting from biomass energy to coal. I dipped my toe in a few more times after my mania but resolved to wait until 1.0 as many of my production lines would need to be seriously re-tooled. Joe suggested we start a co-op save this week and I am back and thriving. We did get into a brief, heated conflict over manifold (my preference) versus balanced production, an argument all couples experience at some point in their relationship, I&rsquo;m sure. I played a little but more of Pokémon Crystal, but I&rsquo;m at a point where I have to grind out levels to take on the next gym, which I&rsquo;m supremely uninterested in doing. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just hack my save. Listening I downloaded the Satisfactory soundtrack and have had that on in the background — it&rsquo;s very good. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m mostly still listening to Rainbow Kitten Surprise. ">

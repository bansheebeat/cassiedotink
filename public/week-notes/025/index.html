<p><em>And Then? And Then? What Else?</em> has become a slog, but I press on nonetheless. There&rsquo;s little here to amuse or excite; even devout Lemony Snicket fans will be disappointed I think by the lack of new information or even commentary concerning the books. Handler confirms that the Baudelaires are named for the poet, that the melodrama of the books is inspired by Edvard Gorey, and that he openly disdains the film â€” hardly revelations by any means. Most egregiously, he seriously downplays the accusations of sexual inappropriateness against him and attempts to use his own childhood sexual assault as a shield against them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think myself hostile to memoirs, but this book has struck me as meandering and self-aggrandizing. Selfishly, I&rsquo;m also frustrated that he finds space to talk about the Snicket books (of course), <em>Why We Broke Up,</em> and <em>The Basic Eight,</em> but there is absolutely no mention of <em>Adverbs.</em> I&rsquo;m pressing on with it because it is an easy (if plodding) read.</p>

<p>I started up <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> again and finally reached First Serpent Lieutenant in my Grand Company, which means I&rsquo;ll now be able to use my seals to get more mounts.</p>
<h1 id="listening">Listening</h1>
<p>I listened to selections from <em>Cerulean</em> and all of <em>Obsidian</em> by Baths, both albums I&rsquo;ve loved at points in my life; <em>Guts</em> is out and I wanted to refresh before listening to it.</p>

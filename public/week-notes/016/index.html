<p>I&rsquo;m still playing <em>Fields of Mistria</em>, although I have had a few mid-day game crashes this week. The game is in early access, so I can&rsquo;t complain too much, but it&rsquo;s the first time it&rsquo;s happened to me. It&rsquo;s frustrating to lose progress, but I suppose I should get into the habit of saving a few times throughout the day.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I listened to <a href="hutchharris.bandcamp.com/album/suck-up-all-the-oxygen"><em>SUCK UP ALL THE OXYGEN</em> by Hutch Harris</a> because I saw the cover on Bandcamp and thought it was funny. The album was fine but not for me. There was a time in my life when I probably would have been really into this, but it&rsquo;s not now.</p>
<p>I picked up my <em>All We Know is Falling</em> listen from last week, too.
6. Never Let This Go - a nice build and pleasant to listen to, but it blends in with a lot of the rest of the album (yet fails to stand out).
7. Whoa - I always loved this one; great energy that lets me overlook the silly lyrics.
8. Conspiracy - forgettable
9. Franklin - I was so surprised by how fond of this song I still am. It&rsquo;s sweet; the backing vocals are a bit distracting — I&rsquo;d rather they were just Hayley, but I understand that they were going for a duet.
10. My Heart - I was listening to a decent rip of this album but this song still somehow sounds like a super compressed 96kbps MP3. The screaming in this song is also so atonal — it feels like a studio note given what was &ldquo;in&rdquo; at the time.
11. Oh Star - another forgettable one for me; I don&rsquo;t really like slow songs in general I think and especially not when Paramore does them.</p>
<p>I went back to <em>fishmonger</em> by underscores. I really love this album (still). I love just about every song on it, but &ldquo;Del mar county fair (2008)&rdquo; is hitting for me in particular lately.</p>

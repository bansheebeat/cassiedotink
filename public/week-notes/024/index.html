      <p>I&rsquo;ve missed a few weeks, so consider this my catch up post before starting my week notes up again&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="doing">Doing</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on migrating off big tech companies — I&rsquo;ve deleted all my twitter accounts and am in the process of migrating from Google Photos to a self-hosted <a href="https://immich.app/">immich</a> service. Joe and I are also working on wiring up some of our house with ethernet: we&rsquo;ve run cable the living room and plan to do the office next. I&rsquo;ve also upgraded my server rack with a patch panel and managed switch (Aruba S2500). That will maybe become a big project post once we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Of course, with the said, I needed a new phone and bought a Google Pixel Pro 9. I&rsquo;m not happy being in Google&rsquo;s ecosystem as much as I am, but there&rsquo;s also no ethical consumption under global capitalism and I don&rsquo;t want the bullshit bloatware other companies put on their Android phones.</p>
<h1 id="reading">Reading</h1>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve given up on <em>Villette</em> for now — it&rsquo;s just not getting me excited to read. I started Daniel Handler&rsquo;s memoir <em>And Then? And Then? What Else?</em> — we&rsquo;ll see how that treats me.</p>
<h1 id="playing">Playing</h1>
<p>I re-played <em>Final Fantasy X</em> with Joe watching; I&rsquo;d been trying for years to get Joe to play it himself, but he stubbornly refused, saying he hated turn-based combat. There are now <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasyxx2hdremaster/mods/228">excellent mods out there</a> to replace the busted HD remaster faces, and we have a working Steam Link setup to let us play PC games on the couch, so the time felt right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say that I loved the game just as much as when I&rsquo;ve played it before. The world of Spira is still beautiful and dense and complicated with a soundtrack to match; every time the leitmotif kicks in, I feel both deeply sad and at home — which I think captures the feeling of Spira so well. Joe asked me which character was my favorite and I said I wasn&rsquo;t sure (it&rsquo;s probably Yuna) because it really is an ensemble cast playing off of each other, each with their own backstory and motivations.</p>
<p>And then the fucking <em>sorrow</em>. This is such a sad game. It&rsquo;s one that sat with me and lingered, even a good week after rolling credits.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much I&rsquo;ll dig into the endgame grinding and final bosses, but I&rsquo;m also not sure I&rsquo;m ready to leave Spira behind just yet. It&rsquo;s a shame there&rsquo;s no other games set in the world for me to play.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h1 id="listening">Listening</h1>
<p>I listened to <a href="https://underscores.bandcamp.com/album/wallsocket"><em>Wallsocket</em> by underscores</a> after really liking <em>fishmonger</em>. It had some good moments, but on the whole, I wasn&rsquo;t a fan.</p>
<p>Horsegirl&rsquo;s full album, <a href="https://thisishorsegirl.bandcamp.com/album/phonetics-on-and-on"><em>Phonetics On and On</em></a>, dropped, and I really like it. &ldquo;Information Content&rdquo; and &ldquo;2468&rdquo; are the standouts to me. I&rsquo;m really excited to see them in a few weeks.</p>
<p>I also listened to <a href="https://afrolab9000.bandcamp.com/album/who-told-you-to-think"><em>who told you to think??!!?!?!?!</em> by Milo</a>, which I found good not great (I really like &ldquo;mrs&rdquo; though), and I downloaded a few Car Seat Headrest albums to listen through. Back when I worked at Radioshack, my manager loved Car Seat Headrest, so we&rsquo;d have them playing in the store quite often. I always liked their sound but just never dived into their discography (partly because it&rsquo;s so fucking confusing). It felt like a good time to change that.</p>

<p>this is, of course, a joke; I have never played <em>Final Fantasy X-2</em> and have some pretty big feelings about some of the bullshit in that game. Maybe one day.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

I&rsquo;m enjoying reading ex-cohost folks on the bearblog discovery feed. The trending feed can get a little stale.1 I hope they stick around. I took a walk (and a run) with a dear friend that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get together with for a while. She&rsquo;s decades older than me, but we are incredibly like-minded. Kindred spirits.

I think I need a break from the sexual deviants I&rsquo;m apparently (and unconsciously) selecting lately. I&rsquo;m glad to be done with this; I appreciated July&rsquo;s occasional wit and found it Handler-esque, but those touches were few and far between, and the rest of it mostly just grossed me out. My next books will be The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating, recommended by a friend and coworker, and, I think, Into the Wild, which I&rsquo;ve always meant to read. It might not seem like much for an English teacher, but these past few months I&rsquo;ve been reading for pleasure more than I have in years and it has me feeling so full. It&rsquo;s great to rediscover that joy.2 &ldquo;Linkin Park, From Zero&rdquo; by n3verm0re. I&rsquo;m not a Linkin Park fan by any means, but I have been interested in seeing how a group reawakens after such a tremendous loss. I really enjoyed this piece about it. Listening Green Dream in F# and Rare Birds, The Bug Club. I asked a student of mine what kind of music she listened to; she said her music was too weird and I&rsquo;d probably never heard of it. I took that as a personal challenge. But it&rsquo;s not that weird — although, as an (ex?) Xiu Xiu listener, my barometer is off. I liked both albums! They&rsquo;re light, fun listening, and absolutely up my alley. Romance is Boring, Los Campesinos! Listening to the music students of mine like has me thinking about the music I was in love with at their age. RiB came out at the exact right time for me and holds a special place in my heart. I listen to tracks from it often, but this was the first time I&rsquo;d revisited some deeper cuts, like &ldquo;Who Fell Asleep In,&rdquo; in years. All Hell, Los Campesinos! I&rsquo;m still forming my larger thoughts on All Hell, but it was interesting to compare side-by-side with RiB. It is far more even and consistent in quality — RiB has some all-timers but also some real duds (&ldquo;Plan A&rdquo;) — but there is a visceral, adolescent melodrama to RiB that All Hell lacks. All Hell is instead grown up and wistfully forlorn, especially compared to juggernauts like &ldquo;I Just Sighed.&rdquo; Both are good and appropriate for me at different times and headspaces, but RiB holds more of hook — although I have fifteen years of relationship and baggage with it compared to All Hell. I&rsquo;m thinking about a recurring theme in songs I am or have been fixated on — &ldquo;Drops (reprise),&rdquo; The Peripheral Ones - &ldquo;I know if I don&rsquo;t go now I won&rsquo;t make it out&rdquo; &ldquo;The Whale Song,&rdquo; Modest Mouse - &ldquo;I guess I am a scout / so I should find a way out / so everyone can find a way out&rdquo; &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; Mac Miller - &ldquo;Have you found a way out?&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Come Back to Earth&rdquo; - &ldquo;I just need a way out of my head / I&rsquo;ll do anything for a way out of my head&rdquo; — the idea of making it out is, of course, not a unique theme, but perhaps it&rsquo;s why The House on Mango Street resonated with me: &ldquo;For the ones I left behind. For the ones who cannot out.&rdquo; I think posts don&rsquo;t decay quickly enough from the feed, and the top page or two of trending posts are all by the same handful of people. There&rsquo;s a handful of very active posters, which is a great thing, but I like to see variety there.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

<p>A friend of mine, a music teacher, told me a few months ago, sadly, that she wasn&rsquo;t finding joy in listening to music recreationally anymore. She made a life change and was hoping to reclaim it. I think that&rsquo;s what inspired me to start reading again. I of course engage with literature in my job as an English teacher, but it&rsquo;s not always mentally stimulating — for the most parts, I&rsquo;m reading the same texts over and over to a young audience.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

  <meta name="description" content="Doing I presented to pre-service teachers at my alma mater with a colleague! Emotionally, I still feel like I was in their spot not that long ago — and then I remember I graduated over six years ago (and into a vastly different world and job market). I&rsquo;m finding myself using ellipses a lot and I do not like it. Is this growing old? Am I becoming a boomer? I&rsquo;m thinking about maintaining some kind of daily log — just simple, passing notes on what I did, what I thought about. Obsidian has this feature built in and it might be a good way to start. I like the idea of it being searchable and (theoretically) infinite in size, but I also want an excuse for another notebook. I used to do daily reflections at the end of my work day. Slowly, those became every few days, then every week, then rarely. It was a good practice that I wish I had maintained, but there&rsquo;s already so much I&rsquo;m packing into my work day — and my goal in daily notes is to be more mindful about what I&rsquo;m doing and thinking in my free time. I attended my state-wide English teacher conference; this is something like my sixth or seventh time attending and I still find it valuable. I left with a lot of great ideas on how to diversify my practice and better empower my students. Watching Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Joe and I have watched a few episodes. I liked the book fine, but the TV show has yet to grab me. It lacks Percy&rsquo;s narrative voice (and personality), and while it&rsquo;s good that Percy is played by an actual child, his pre-pubescent voice freaks me out. Broad City. Joe and I watched a lot of Broad City early in our relationship, but we never finished it. We are starting it over from the beginning. Still funny! Listening Charli XCX, Brat and it&rsquo;s completely different but also still brat. Every re-release and new drop for brat innovates, co-exists, and complements. The features on this remix album feel like an ode to the remarkable original release and a statement of how pivotal the album has been personally and for the industry writ large. This version of &ldquo;Everything is romantic&rdquo; is as much a remix as an iteration; the original captures a single moment in beautiful, mimetic detail, and this one is another artist following the theme and form with their own experiences. brat is undoubtedly a project we&rsquo;ll all be talking about when we discuss the music of the 2020s; I love witnessing its creation in real time. For the haters, a friend of mine said the mixing was bad and that it &ldquo;just sounds like noise.&rdquo; I still like her (Charli and the friend, in that order1). Foxholes, Foxholes. I found &ldquo;Alligator&rdquo; while going through Daytrotter archives and loved it; the rest of the album is pleasant listening, but &ldquo;Alligator&rdquo; is the stand out. Yung Lean, Stardust. I loved Yung Lean&rsquo;s feature on Brat and it&rsquo;s completely different but also still brat; imagine my surprise when I discovered that the esoteric bullshit (or so I thought) I was listening to ten&#43; years ago as a joke but not really went on to be a critically recognized artist. I thought it was just a weird fucking song. Stardust is a much more polished and, dare I say, coherent and digestible2 product than &ldquo;Hurt&rdquo;; I like it, but I&rsquo;m not sure any of the songs will earn the coveted ⭐ on Plex.3 It&rsquo;s music I&rsquo;d have to be in a mood for — although the mumble-y nature of it makes it good background music while working. Maybe it just needs to sit with me a little more. just kidding :-)&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

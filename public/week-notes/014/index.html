  <meta name="description" content="first week notes in a while so some of this might not be strictly &ldquo;this week&rdquo;
Doing I turned 30. I had a big party with lots of friends — and I feel grateful to have so many folks who want to celebrate with me, including some who drove substantial distances. I still have a bunch of mixed up feelings about crossing this threshold, but I&rsquo;m trying to remember the advice of a friend: it&rsquo;s a gift to grow older. This maybe belongs under a playing heading, but maybe not: I picked up Ring Fit Adventure for the first time since the pandemic. It&rsquo;s getting to be too cold out to run, so I need an alternate fitness option. My most reliable gym buddy moved away, so I&rsquo;m seeing if I can get Ring Fit to stick again. I am definitely in way better shape than when I was playing years ago; I would feel faint after 20-30 minutes in the game, but my first session was over 30 minutes and I felt fine (albeit sweaty) after. Turning 30 feels like an inflection point where I need to get serious about losing weight. I also went to the gym for the first time in months to run on the treadmill. With snow season upon us, I need to transition to indoor running. I like it quite a bit less, but I don&rsquo;t want to lose progress. We had our first big snow of the season on Friday, which meant a (much-needed) lazy snow day at home. Watching Daria, season four. I started rewatching Daria around Halloween because I dressed as her for the holiday. I still love it and I still hate Tom. Friends at the Table&rsquo;s Fields of Mistria streams. I&rsquo;m not a FatT fan — actual play podcasts do not appeal to me at all — but Joe is, and I otherwise like a lot of the personalities on the show. Ali is probably my favorite and Joe and I love farming games like Mistria a whole lot. Playing Pokémon Crystal Legacy. I had a hankering of Gen 2 nostalgia hit me, so I&rsquo;ve been working my way through this ROM hack. I know a lot of my love for Gen 2 stems from it being my first Pokémon — and, indeed, one of the first games I really ever played — but I&rsquo;m happy to report that it&rsquo;s just as charming as I remember. Listening Rainbow Kitten Surprise, RKS. Listened on the recommendation of a friend; I was concerned initially because I really didn&rsquo;t like the first track (my words: &ldquo;Big garage vibes. Like shit you listen to while you work on your motorcycle&rdquo;), but after that hump, I really loved the album. My tops are &ldquo;Cold Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wasted,&rdquo; &ldquo;All&rsquo;s Well That Ends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lady Lie.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cold Love&rdquo; in particular has really hung around in my head.

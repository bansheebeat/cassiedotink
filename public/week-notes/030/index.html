      <h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>I taught my first college class! It went far better than I anticipated; by about half an hour in, I fell into my natural teacher mode and it was smooth sailing from there. I&rsquo;m excited to work with the kids<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and see how I do throughout the semester. I still have deep-seated imposter syndrome about teaching (<em>adjunct lecturing</em>) the course on a macro-level, but the day-by-day is at least seeming more feasible.</p>
<p>For context,  the college I&rsquo;m teaching (<em>adjunct lecturing</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) at is my alma mater. I transferred there as a junior from community college, and this course is the first one I took there — with a professor who went on to become a mentor and a personal friend. She scared the shit out of me then (she still does) because she is <em>so good</em> at what she does, so experienced, and (seemingly) effortlessly incredible as a teacher. The idea that I have to, in some way, fill her shoes — teach her class, in the same room I took it, nine years later — is absolutely terrifying. Who am I to tell these kids how to teach?? I have very lovely friends who have talked me up and assured me that I&rsquo;ll do a great job, but I think I&rsquo;ll never be able to shake the feeling that I&rsquo;m not doing what she would have (or not doing as good as her). Of course that&rsquo;s ridiculous and I need to be my own person, and it is within this contradiction that I must exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to my classroom a few times this week getting some of the bigger projects done. I&rsquo;ll have time to put on finishing touches on the teacher conference days next week, but I&rsquo;d rather cut open 96 tennis balls at a relaxed pace than rush to do it the day before kids show up.</p>
<p>Site-wise, I&rsquo;m continuing to backport content from an old blog. This week I&rsquo;ve added&hellip;</p>

<p>I did a <em>lot</em> of podcast listening this week! Cleaning and organizing my classroom has been a good opportunity for it because it&rsquo;s mostly mindless labor. I&rsquo;ve been digging through Into the Aether&rsquo;s <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> episodes (<a href="https://pca.st/ryz2z5wd">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep | Bonus</a> and <a href="https://pca.st/m4xgagit">I Norted Myself</a>) plus the <a href="https://pca.st/Kj2p">Song Exploder episode on &ldquo;Miasma Sky.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of <em>Pure Particles</em> by The Bug Club. It has some of my favorite songs of theirs (&ldquo;If My Mother Thinks I&rsquo;m Happy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pure Particles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Love Song,&rdquo; primarily). I haven&rsquo;t been quite as enthused with their more recent releases — <em>Very Human Features</em> was good, and I didn&rsquo;t really care about <em>On the Intricate Inner Workings of the System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> — but <em>Pure Particles</em> through <em>Rare Birds</em> is such an incredible run of quality.</p>
<p>As part of my mission to upgrade the low quality MP3s I have on my music server, I ordered and ripped a few CDs this week: Johnny Flynn&rsquo;s <em>A Larum</em>, Mirah&rsquo;s <em>C&rsquo;mon Miracle</em>, and Freelance Whales&rsquo;s <em>Weathervanes</em>. I was really only looking for <em>A Larum</em> specifically, but the seller on discogs had a shipping minimum. The others were on my list and the seller happened to have them available. It&rsquo;s a little funny — I was listening to these albums all at a specific point in my life (specifically <em>C&rsquo;mon Miracle</em> and <em>Weathervanes</em> when I was really depressed in my late teens; Johnny Flynn was a bit earlier).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found myself referring to the students as &ldquo;kids.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re juniors and seniors in college, so probably at most around ten years younger than me. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a speech pattern picked up from teaching middle schoolers, who I can safely call kids, or if I&rsquo;m an old lady now. More on that later.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

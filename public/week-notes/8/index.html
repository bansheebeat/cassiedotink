Reading Death Is Not an Option by Suzanne Rivecca. Finished at last. I have not much new to say compared to last week. I felt a notable sense of relief to be done with it and free to move on.

I&rsquo;m not a good enough writer for this to be applicable, so call this aspirational reading. back at it &amp; social media free by kristin. I&rsquo;ve pretty much dropped Twitter in the last few weeks — I really want to separate myself from toxic online spaces. Please please please please please please share your big dumb beautiful self with the world by Keenan. &ldquo;What does it look like to put yourself on a page, or in a photo, or a brushstroke, or a string plucked and reverberating harmoniously out into the room?

Top Model is my comfort show right now. I love the first seven cycles best, but cycle three has a special place in my heart. It&rsquo;s one of the first cycles I ever saw and has one of the most entertaining casts. The modelling itself is pretty poor, but that&rsquo;s not really what Top Model was about. Run Button&rsquo;s Star Wars Outlaws streams. I&rsquo;m really interested in Outlaws based on what I&rsquo;ve seen; Keith has been complaining about the stealth a lot in the streams, but I think a good amount of that has been player error. Playing Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords. I&rsquo;ve tried to get Joe to play KotOR for years, but he was turned off by the combat. We listened to A More Civilized Age&rsquo;s coverage together, though (he&rsquo;s a big Friends at the Table fan), and it got him interested in KotOR II (despite my insisting for years that it is the finest piece of Star Wars media). We&rsquo;re playing through together — me with the controller but collectively making decisions. We&rsquo;re still on Peragus (gross), but I&rsquo;m enjoying revisiting it. This will be my first time playing it in at least ten years and my first time with the restored content mod. Listening Life&rsquo;s a Riot With Spy vs Spy, Billy Bragg. I like &ldquo;A New England&rdquo; a whole lot; the rest was good but didn&rsquo;t grab me. There&rsquo;s a sparseness and intimacy that struck me when I first heard &ldquo;A New England,&rdquo; but the novelty had worn off for the other tracks. For Emma, Forever Ago, Bon Iver. I listened to this all the way through one night and it unfortunately really spoke to me. I know I&rsquo;ve listened through it before, years ago, and I didn&rsquo;t care for anything except &ldquo;Skinny Love&rdquo;; this time around, every track hit. &ldquo;Bishop, CA&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wig Master,&rdquo; Xiu Xiu. I swore off Xiu Xiu back in 2013 or so after listening to them heavily during a deep depression; I&rsquo;m not cold turkey on them anymore, but they&rsquo;re not in my regular rotation either. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of these two, some of my favorites then.1 in so far as any Xiu Xiu song is a &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; and not &ldquo;a desperate cry for help&rdquo;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Death Is Not an Option by Suzanne Rivecca. I&rsquo;m about halfway through this.

We are not far in, but we are enjoying it so far. Playing Rock Band 4. I have a friend visiting this week — it&rsquo;s a great party game. Carcassone. A board game staple in my house. Listening Nothing particular beyond some shuffles, but my mom came over with her old Fleetwood Mac records and we realized that my record player has been spinning slightly too fast (~33.7rpm instead of 33.3). I noticed it months ago with Mac Miller&rsquo;s GO:ODAM, but I thought it might just be the press. We fixed it and now I feel I have to re-listen to all my records. ">

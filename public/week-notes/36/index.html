</h2><p>I&rsquo;m sick <em>again</em> (still?). As I wrote last week, I&rsquo;ve had a lingering cough for going on two weeks. I visited urgent care and received a non-specific diagnosis, but they gave me an inhaler and said to come back if I wasn&rsquo;t better in a week or two. On Wednesday or Thursday, I came down with a regular cold. It&rsquo;s manageable, and I&rsquo;m hoping it knocks whatever the cough was out of my system, but it feels like I can&rsquo;t catch a break. Joe has been sick too, so we&rsquo;ve been barely making it by; the house is messy and there are a lot of  projects that I&rsquo;d like to get to, but neither of us have felt up it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been drowning in work. Last weekend and early this week, I finally caught up on grading for my middle schoolers and filed report cards. I&rsquo;m at last in a good place there, but I have a <em>ton</em> of grading to catch up on for my college course now. That grading luckily goes pretty quick — I only have eleven students in the class — but it&rsquo;s been weighing on the back of my mind anytime I have a free moment. We are winding down with the class now — we only have I think four more sessions — and I&rsquo;m thinking a lot about whether I would teach it again. It&rsquo;s only offered in the fall, so I have time to think about it, but it&rsquo;s hard to say what my life is going to look like a year from now. I have enjoyed teaching the class and working with older students, but it&rsquo;s also an added workload that I just don&rsquo;t need. The extra money is nice, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s worth the time and energy I&rsquo;m putting in.</p>
<p>My birthday is coming up next week and Joe asked if there was anything I&rsquo;d like to do. I had a big party last year to celebrate turning 30 and had a really nice time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but 31 doesn&rsquo;t feel like such a big deal.</p>
<p>On a meta-level, I had some weirdness with this site deploying; right now, everything is on <a href="https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie/cassiedotink">32bitcafe&rsquo;s Gitea instance</a>, which then mirrors to a Github repo. That Github repo is attached to Cloudflare Pages, which builds, deploys, and serves the website for me. Some media (images, mostly) is hosted on a bunny.net storage zone. It ended up being a minor problem with 32bitcafe, which they resolved quickly after I pointed it out. Broadly, though, I&rsquo;d like to cut out my dependency on Github and maybe even Cloudflare. <a href="https://burgeonlab.com/blog/hosting-static-sites-with-github-pages-or-bunny-net/">Naty has success pushing from a repo to bunny</a>, but I just haven&rsquo;t had the time to sit down and hash it out. Maybe other my winter break in a few weeks. I do think I need to stop trying to use Obsidian Sync <em>and</em> the obsidian-git plugin at the same time and focus just on the latter. I&rsquo;m still happy with Sync for other vaults that don&rsquo;t become websites<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;ve had a lot of conflicts between the two, especially on mobile.</p>
<p>I also had a dream that I was doing an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> rewatch podcast. I don&rsquo;t know realistically that that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d actually want to do, but it probably says something that podcasting is still in my subconscious. I did briefly think that, once my college class ends, I could use that block of time to podcast instead&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve read a bit more of <em>Villette</em> this week. It&rsquo;s still quite slow-going — I maybe only read fifteen pages — but it&rsquo;s not a thrilling, plot-heavy book, so it almost feels like small weekly check-ins on Lucy Snowe. I&rsquo;d like to develop the habit of reading a few pages while I eat my breakfast in the morning and then a few more before I go to bed. The former is doable, but with the latter, I usually nod off too quickly for it to really be worthwhile.</p>

</h2><p>I finished off <em>Weeds</em> and moved on to rewatching <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. I really loved the first two seasons of <em>OitNB</em> when they first came out (and I think I intend to only rewatch them, as I didn&rsquo;t like the prison riot turn or what happened after that). I&rsquo;m enjoying it on the rewatch, but I&rsquo;m not as taken with it as I was back then. I think it felt really revolutionary and fresh at the time, but ten plus years on, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like such a big thing to have queer women and women of color on the screen. I&rsquo;m happy for that, of course! I&rsquo;m still early in season one, so I haven&rsquo;t gotten to any of the big storytelling swings and maybe my opinion will change then. I also remember a lot more of the jokes than I expected, so there&rsquo;s a bit less novelty this time around, too.</p>

</h2><p>I started <em>Pokémon Legends ZA</em> using the virtual game card borrowing from Joe&rsquo;s system. I&rsquo;m tepid on it; it&rsquo;s definitely miles ahead of <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, which I thought had some good ideas but was executed so poorly that it turned me off of Pokémon, I think, in a pretty big way. But I loved <em>Legends Arceus</em> so, so much and I&rsquo;m disappointed that this game isn&rsquo;t hitting the same notes for me. <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/why-pokemon-legends-works">Brendon Bigley wrote a bit about going into <em>ZA</em> after loving <em>Arceus</em>:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having now spent around 15 hours running around Pokémon’s version of Paris, I’m starting to better understand what makes a Legends game in comparison to the mainline entries: It’s not an exploration of the history of the pokémon world, it’s an exploration of a specific time and place in the Pokémon world. A fulcrum point in their society.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose then that maybe the issue isn&rsquo;t the game itself but rather my hopes and expectations for it. But <em>Arceus</em> had such a strong, refreshing vibe that <em>ZA</em> so far hasn&rsquo;t surfaced for me. There&rsquo;s some vague techno-futurism, but it&rsquo;s otherwise just a (lovingly realized, detailed, well-executed — words I can&rsquo;t use to describe any other recent Pokémon games) city in the Pokémon universe. We&rsquo;ll see if it eventually sinks its claws into me.</p>

</h2><p>I listened through to <em>Infra</em> by Max Richter for the first time in probably close to ten years. This album was once the background when I&rsquo;d write (mostly Star Wars fanfiction). I was looking for something low-key to have on while grading, but I found a sense memory in it and added to my vault of unpublishable personal writing.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my top ten songs from the week (based somewhat on plays, with edits):</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Moody Orange&rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise</li>
<li>&ldquo;Infra 5&rdquo; by Max Richter</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cold Love&rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Sea is a Good Place to Think of the Future&rdquo; by Los Campesinos!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Bubble in My Bloodstream&rdquo; by Martha</li>
<li>&ldquo;Love Machine&rdquo; by Being Dead</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pure Particles&rdquo; by The Bug Club</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tenuousness&rdquo; by Andrew Bird</li>
<li>&ldquo;Breakin&rsquo; the Law&rdquo; by The New Pornographers</li>
<li>&ldquo;We Are All Accelerated Readers&rdquo; by Los Campesinos!</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to Rainbow Kitten Surprise&rsquo;s new album (<em>bones</em>) at the time of writing, but I want to sit with it longer before typing up any thoughts.</p>

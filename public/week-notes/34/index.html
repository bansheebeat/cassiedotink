      <p>This week has been <em>rough</em>. As <a href="https://cassie.ink/week-notes/033/">I wrote last week</a>, I was out sick from work three days, so all this week I&rsquo;ve been playing catch up — trying to dig myself out of the hole while also keeping head above water with everything new that&rsquo;s happening<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The group of kids I have this year are really likeable, but they&rsquo;re incredibly immature. I&rsquo;m dealing with a lot of classroom management challenges, which has rarely been an issue for me<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I&rsquo;m struggling to keep them in their seats and have a coherent lesson without interruptions. One class in particular is incredibly challenging and it&rsquo;s really starting to wear on me. I love what I <em>do</em>, in a general sense, but lately, I&rsquo;m not happy to go to work. I dread the middle portion of my day in particular (tough class and then immediately into lunch duty). The highlights have been few and far between; I&rsquo;m constantly disappointed in myself that I&rsquo;m not doing a better job even though I know a lot of these struggles are bigger than me and my classroom. On top of that, I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of not fun expenses crop up this week — a $2500 repair bill on my car, we had our septic tank pumped, and we&rsquo;re trying to get a plumber in because our shower drain isn&rsquo;t draining — and other adult shit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. All in, this week has been filled with an overwhelming number of stressors piling together.</p>
<p>I did have a bit of a breakthrough with my college class, however. It&rsquo;s been going well for weeks now, but this week&rsquo;s class in particular felt like I was finally an authentic version of myself as a teacher (albeit to an older audience than I&rsquo;m used to) rather than trying to be the professor I took the class with (now a friend and mentor). I feel I&rsquo;ve at last released myself from lofty expectations, perfectionism and trying to squash myself into a mold and just be <em>me</em>. Of course, I still have the nagging voice that says that I&rsquo;m not good enough or doing enough, but perhaps drowning that out is the next frontier.</p>
<p>We did creative non-fiction writing this week in the class (inspired by <em>Mango Street</em>), which is my favorite genre to write, and it has me thinking about the personal writing I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;ve always considered it unpublishable and unworthy to be shared even with friends (especially with friends?), but I simultaneously feel compelled to push myself out of that comfort zone and pursue it more seriously. It&rsquo;s fucking personal, though, and scary to submit myself to the mortifying ordeal of being known — but then again, this is my blog, and if I can&rsquo;t bring myself to publish it here, the words will forever rot and die on my hard drive,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> which feels a cruel fate to subject them to, not the least because I&rsquo;ve labored so much over them.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I <a href="https://social.lol/@cass/115275010398353612">posted on Mastodon</a> that I think I&rsquo;m about to get into fountain pens. Maybe a year ago, I got a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Preppy-Fountain-Pen-Black-02-Extra-Fine/pd/24020">Platinum Preppy EF</a> in a JetPens starter pack. I&rsquo;d never used a fountain pen before, and when I tried it out, I found it really unpleasant to write with and stuffed it in a desk drawer. A few months ago, though, some students who are into calligraphy and bujo came to talk to me about pens, and I pulled it out to show them — and I found I loved writing with it. It ran out of ink recently, so I decided to do a little research on fountain pens and ordered a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/TWSBI-SWIPE-Smoke-Fountain-Pen-Extra-Fine/pd/32576">TSWBI Swipe</a>, a couple cartridges, and a syringe. It finally came in today and I found the line <em>way</em> too thick — I have small handwriting and generally use .03 gel pens. The Preppy felt good to me — a little thicker but not unreasonable — so I&rsquo;m disappointed. I&rsquo;ve only tried the Swipe on shitty copy paper so far and will give it a go on better quality stock, but I&rsquo;m thinking now of ordering a converter and bottled ink to use with the Preppy. It&rsquo;s such a complicated world to dive into, though! If there are fountain pen people out there reading this, I appreciate any guidance!</p>

</h2><p>I&rsquo;m still technically reading <em>Villette,</em> a few pages at a time; this time, it&rsquo;s less an indictment of the text and more how fucking busy I&rsquo;ve been. I&rsquo;m genuinely enjoying it (and excessively entertained by Lucy&rsquo;s homoerotic fascination with Madame Beck) and dying to go back to it, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to make time for reading this week. I&rsquo;m so exhausted by the time I get home and eat dinner that I can&rsquo;t mentally commit to reading — and forget finding time during the school day like I&rsquo;ve been able to in the past.</p>

</h2><p>I&rsquo;m still rewatching <em>Weeds</em> and my feelings are mostly unchanged: I&rsquo;m here for Nancy and Mary Louise Parker&rsquo;s performance. I&rsquo;m into the Ren-Mar season now, where Esteban is introduced and looms large; I remember this being when I started to turn on the show when I watched it the first time, so we&rsquo;ll see if I begin to wane on it again or if my feelings about him change (they have not yet — I find his mafia boss shit weird and gross even if it&rsquo;s a natural character progression for Nancy).</p>

</h2><p>I bought the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster against my better judgement (not really — I&rsquo;d just hoped to have finished <em>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3</em> at this point). I was a huge fan of <em>Tactics Advance</em> as a kid and was always curious about <em>Tactics</em>, but rumors have swelled for years about a potential remaster, so I always put off playing it until the remaster dropped. I&rsquo;m only in Chapter 2, but I really love it so far; it&rsquo;s the fluid and customizable job system that I loved from <em>Tactics Advance</em>, and I&rsquo;m more interested in the story than I anticipated. I&rsquo;ve always heard that it&rsquo;s super political, which it is, but there&rsquo;s enough of a human angle in the relationship with Ramza and Delita that I find it compelling and am excited to see what happens next. I&rsquo;d like to say I&rsquo;ll be able to find time during the coming week to play it more.</p>

</h2><p>I listened to <em>Food in the Belly</em> by Xavier Rudd because &ldquo;Messages&rdquo; was in an episode of <em>Weeds</em>. I found the album mostly forgettable outside of the one song.</p>
<p>kitty put out a new song (<a href="https://kitty.bandcamp.com/track/cassadaga-fairy-garden">&ldquo;cassadaga fairy garden&rdquo;</a>) that I think is really cool. It feels like D&amp;B track fused with BOPPLES and Ninajirachi. I really dug <a href="https://kitty.bandcamp.com/track/international-thirst-championship">&ldquo;international thirst champion,&rdquo;</a> too, which came out earlier this year.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I&rsquo;m going back to Future&rsquo;s &ldquo;Red Leather&rdquo; a lot this week. I think it was in a dream I had, and it&rsquo;s been caught in my head ever since. I love a guitar in a rap song, I think (see also: Polo G&rsquo;s &ldquo;Martin &amp; Gina&rdquo; and Raury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amor&rdquo; — the outro, at least).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to maybe start including my top ten songs every week in a kind of playlist feature here? Bandcamp launched a playlist feature<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> that I could use, but it could also just be a list. Right now remote access to my Plex server is being weird and my plays haven&rsquo;t been scrobbling properly unless I&rsquo;m on my home network<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, so I&rsquo;m working off of just the Plex stats, which seem wrong. Regardless, here&rsquo;s what I have for this week — a mix of most played and songs I&rsquo;m just thinking about, in no particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Red Leather&rdquo; by Future</li>
<li>&ldquo;cassadaga fairy garden&rdquo; by Kitty</li>
<li>&ldquo;Amor&rdquo; by Raury</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sickset&rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise</li>
<li>&ldquo;She Crows (Documented Minor Emotional Breakdown #4)&rdquo; by Los Campesinos!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tin Man&rdquo; by feeble little horse</li>
<li>&ldquo;Messages&rdquo; by Xavier Rudd</li>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Called: Freefall&rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cold Love&rdquo; by Rainbow Kitten Surprise</li>
<li>&ldquo;I Love the Valley&rdquo; by Ten in the Swear Jar</li>
</ol>

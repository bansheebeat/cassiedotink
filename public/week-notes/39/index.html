</h2><p>I added a <a href="https://cassie.ink/books/">&ldquo;bookshelf&rdquo; (reading tracker) to this site</a>! It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a long time,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but I finally felt I had the time, understanding of Hugo templates, and workflow with Obsidian to make it happen. It&rsquo;s pretty empty right now and therefore I appear as a rube who has read only one and half books, but luckily I was able to add a miniscule disclaimer to the bottom of the page that defends my reputation (reproduced below).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started tracking the books I&rsquo;ve read in November of 2025. I have read way more than this! It is important to me to establish this credibility because I have half of an English degree and teach English as a day job!</p></blockquote>
<p>I did a few other little tweaks here and there around the site. Maybe when I have time I&rsquo;ll do a proper little write-up of the aberrant and unsound process by which I created the bookshelf.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this week was Thanksgiving.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Joe and I went to his family for it, which was mostly fine. No major drama, but it&rsquo;s only there that I feel completely anti-social and unable to make conversation. After we got back, it was nice to have some downtime around the house to rest and relax — being sick for something like the last month has left me without a good night&rsquo;s rest in some time. I&rsquo;m on the upswing, though, and I was able to resume my Sunday Runday routine with a friend (though our runs have moved to an indoor track what with the cold weather).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost done with my college course, and I&rsquo;m still waiting to hear back on the logistics behind my move to the high school. I&rsquo;m planning to (as much as is possible for me) coast through the next few weeks of teaching middle school and instead focus on preparing for the change, but I&rsquo;ve realized that I am in some ways a phenomenally impatient person: once I set my mind to doing something — like changing jobs — I hate waiting for it to happen, but I also don&rsquo;t want to phone things in entirely for the month or two that I have left. It&rsquo;s the being caught between things that frustrates me; when I do something, I jump in with my whole heart. I just want to take that plunge.</p>

</h2><p>I re-read Gene Luen Yang&rsquo;s <a href="https://cassie.ink/books/american-born-chinese/"><em>American Born Chinese</em></a>, which is the last text for my college course. I first read this nine years ago when I took the class; I remember enjoying it and finding the twist novel. This time around, I flew through and was surprised by how much of it I remembered — in my head, it was a lot longer and more complicated. It&rsquo;s a book I would have considered for my middle school curriculum if I was staying at the grade level.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t touched <em>Villette</em> much this week what with the travel and trying to burn through <em>American Born Chinese</em>. I am resolved to finish it before the end of the year.</p>

</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve gone back to <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. I&rsquo;m still really enjoying it, though the long breaks I&rsquo;ve taken have left me a little lost when it comes to all the different factions and individuals vying for power in the game&rsquo;s plot. I really like a lot of the major characters (Delita, mostly, and Agrias), and so I&rsquo;m choosing to focus more on their individual, emotional journeys rather than all the intricate political machinations. I&rsquo;m keeping up with the broad strokes of the story just fine, but it seems like a notable change from the me of 15 years ago that read the entire <em>Mass Effect</em> codex, and I&rsquo;m not sure what to attribute that to. The lore of <em>Tactics</em> is much drier, I suppose, and I think my priorities have changed along with the time I have to actually sit down and play games — now that my play sessions are fewer and farther between, I&rsquo;m not really eager to spend them reading a damn book off the screen.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

</h2><p>I listened to <a href="https://album.link/b/4022399652"><em>Apologies to the Queen Mary</em></a> several times over on Saturday night; I&rsquo;d listened to it before and frequently returned to songs like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Believe in Anything&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grounds for Divorce,&rdquo; but the rest of it got lost in the mix. It&rsquo;s worth listening to full through as a complete album, but previously overlooked tracks like &ldquo;Modern World&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Curse&rdquo; are really hitting right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with <a href="https://symfonium.app/">Symfonium</a> for my mobile listening. I am having issues with Plexamp scrobbling my plays, and I like that Symfonium is open source and platform agnostic. Symfonium isn&rsquo;t quite as pretty as Plexamp (though it is very customizable), and it seems to dump all the scrobbles with the timestamp of when I came back online, but these are minor pain points so far. I still wish there was a version for the desktop, but maybe there are other options I haven&rsquo;t explored yet.</p>
<p>Since my plays aren&rsquo;t tracking correctly, this is based on specious data, but here&rsquo;s my  ten for the week — I&rsquo;m still waiting on my notebook to come in to start doing these on paper.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2025/12/1) -</strong> It looks like I might have resolved my syncing issues. I was originally using <a href="https://eavesdrop.fm/">eavesdrop.fm</a> to sync Plex data to ListenBrainz (I don&rsquo;t really use or check last.fm anymore). Because I&rsquo;m dealing with remote access issues with my Plex server, eavesdrop.fm wasn&rsquo;t picking up the plays, as it requires a persistent connection to the server. I&rsquo;ve removed the eavesdrop webhook and am now using ListenBrainz&rsquo;s automatic last.fm import tool.</p>

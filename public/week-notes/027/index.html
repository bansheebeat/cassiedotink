      <h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on planning for the college class I&rsquo;m teaching in a few weeks. I <em>need</em> to have my basic syllabus done within the next week or two, but I don&rsquo;t really plan that way, so I&rsquo;m going week by week and outlining the entire lesson. It&rsquo;s a lot of work, but I&rsquo;m <a href="https://cassie.ink/week-notes/026/">feeling a lot better than I was last week</a>. I was previously trying to reverse engineer the previous professor&rsquo;s syllabus while bringing in some of my own resources, but I gave myself permission to do my own thing and only consult her work when I felt I needed something more for a lesson or a text. I&rsquo;m moving much faster and things feel easier now, so it&rsquo;s just a matter of doing the work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with the idea for a while now of buying a new monitor for my desk at work — the school issues me one (and I asked for a second to have a dual monitor setup, which they did give me), but they&rsquo;re pretty bottom of the barrel office displays. They&rsquo;re not even 1080p, which is a real pain for grading on our archaic LMS. I hunted around for deals on a cheap display, but I found that anything worth spending money on far outpaced my displays at home (a Dell S2340M that I bought in 2015 and an ASUS VZ239H-W from 2016 that I inherited from my sister). I ended up cashing in some of my credit card rewards points and taking advantage of a sale<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to get a KTC H27T22C-3, which will be a big upgrade for me (23&quot; to 27&quot;; 1080p to 1440p; much higher refresh rate and a new IPS panel). Then I got on my bullshit and started researching monitor arms — I&rsquo;ve always wanted one, but neither of my previous displays were VESA compatible. I found a crazy deal for a white Ergotron MXV dual monitor mount on eBay (a little over $100 shipped), bought a VESA adapter for the Dell and a plate to distribute the weight on my desk, and now I&rsquo;m just waiting for everything to come in. This coming school year, I really want to stop staying at work so late and just do my grading and planning at home, where I have a much more comfortable and quality set up<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (including a Steelcase Leap v2, which I recently found on Facebook Marketplace in mint condition for $175).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also justifying my recent exorbitant spending on my office as a way to stop spending so much fucking time on my phone and instead put that energy into writing, building websites, playing games, and maybe getting back into content creation.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I&rsquo;ll take the ASUS to school; maybe a few years down the line when they get to be reasonably priced, I&rsquo;ll get an OLED and replace the Dell, but for now, it works just fine for a secondary display.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Most of my reading from here on out is going to be prep work for my college class and for the coming school year. I&rsquo;m almost done with <em>Speak</em> by Laurie Halse Anderson, which I&rsquo;m glad to say is as good as I remember it — it was a favorite of mine as a teen. I also recently learned that there&rsquo;s a graphic novel version that I&rsquo;d like to get my hands on one day. Frankly, I&rsquo;d love to teach this book one day in the classroom (not for a college course) — even if it is dated in terms of publication year (the themes are perennial) — but that&rsquo;s not really possible with the age group that I teach right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also refreshing myself on chapters from <em>Literature for Young Adults: Books (and More) for Contemporary Readers</em> by Joan L. Knickerbocker and James A. Rycik, which is our textbook for the course and is about as exciting as it sounds (though useful). I know <em>The House on Mango Street</em> by Sandra Cisneros well enough that I was able to plan from memory, but I pulled two poems from <em>Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood</em> by Judith Ortiz Cofer to pair with it. I first read the better part of <em>Silent Dancing</em> in undergrad — I think for a world lit class — and really loved it; the title story is particularly resonant and haunting. I&rsquo;d like to go back and read it in full when I&rsquo;m less bogged down with work.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>Joe and I are still watching old seasons of <em>Survivor</em> — we&rsquo;re on <em>Caramoan</em> right now. There are no returning players for 50 on it, but we enjoyed <em>South Pacific</em>, and I see <em>Caramoan</em> as kind of part two of that season. We&rsquo;re still following <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzb96hSa04DPbyVmGawLPUYr9DUG99k8Q">Austin Walker&rsquo;s Let&rsquo;s Play of <em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em> </a> and then watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIAGhNc7IWXxCHc55BwOsuTgMrDM8smSU">Friends at the Table Ali&rsquo;s <em>Mistria</em> Mondays</a> when we need turn off our brain content. I&rsquo;ve pushed into season four of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, but it&rsquo;s losing its luster. I would like to maybe finish it, though&hellip; again, maybe when I&rsquo;m less busy with work.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on my <em>Fields of Mistria</em> bullshit now that we&rsquo;re home. At this point, I&rsquo;ve exhausted a lot of the content currently available, which isn&rsquo;t a bad place to be — I&rsquo;ve <em>seen</em> just about everything (except heart events, which I really don&rsquo;t interact with in these types of games) and now can focus on 100%ing things and beautifying my farm. There&rsquo;s still a few things that will unlock at higher town ranks, and I can keep looking forward to the regular updates.</p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I listened to <em>Tapestry</em> by Carole King. I&rsquo;m not really sure why — I knew it wasn&rsquo;t really going to be for me. It&rsquo;s a legendary album and I&rsquo;m sure deserves its place in music history, but as an individual listener in 2025, I found it a bit ho-hum.</p>
<p>I also listened to <a href="%5Bhttps://pca.st/5wv7133q%5D(https://pca.st/5wv7133q" title="https://pca.st/5wv7133q">Outside the Lobby</a>&rsquo;s episode on <em>The Order 1886</em> after one of the hosts shared it in a Discord group I&rsquo;m in. It was a great, funny episode that I enjoyed despite being an <em>Order</em> sicko (they were quite negative about the game). I&rsquo;m so fucking into music lately that I don&rsquo;t make much time for podcast listening, but I would like to listen to more of their episodes.</p>
<p>I also listened to <a href="https://ninajirachi.bandcamp.com/album/i-love-my-computer"><em>I Love My Computer</em> by Ninajirachi</a>, which fucking bangs. Recommended for fans of Charli XCX&rsquo;s earlier, more PC music-adjacent era<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and general hyperpop/EDM folks. Listen to &ldquo;Fuck My Computer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Delete,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All I Am&rdquo; for a taste of what the whole album is like; I&rsquo;m particularly enamored with &ldquo;Sing Good,&rdquo; but the whole album feels like an ode to teenage creativity and terminally online behavior, for which I am squarely in the audience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been slowly cutting down on my Amazon purchasing — I&rsquo;m hoping to be almost entirely off of it soon — but I don&rsquo;t have any brick and mortar electronics stores around me aside from Walmart, which feels like a lateral move&hellip; and a bitch needs a discount every now and then.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Ideally I would be doing no work outside of the school day, but that&rsquo;s not the reality of teaching — and also I am a workaholic and perfectionist. Let me live.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I love <em>brat</em> and believe it brought PC Music&rsquo;s innovative sound to the mainstream, but that also works against it: it&rsquo;s somewhat diluted compared to the bizarre, abstract, creative shit that PC Music and similar artists put out over the years.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

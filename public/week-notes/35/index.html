      <p>This is an amalgamation of whatever I can remember over the last few weeks. I am almost certainly missing things, but I&rsquo;m trying to reset and start up again.</p>
<h2 id="doing">Doing</h2>
<p>Lately I really just feel like shit. I&rsquo;ve had a cough for going on a week and a half. According to urgent care, it&rsquo;s a post-viral lingering cough. I don&rsquo;t remember having something viral, but, well, teaching middle school means I&rsquo;m exposed to all kinds of nasty shit. I&rsquo;m glad to not have any other symptoms, but the cough has kept me up at night and indirectly given me a sore throat. And then, mentally, I&rsquo;m going through phases. There are days where I feel totally blank, empty, detached — and then days where I feel so stressed, so angry, and completely unable to do anything about it. I took on teaching a college class this semester because I stepped back from some commitments at my full-time job and because I am at a place where I basically have my entire curriculum set for the year. Unfortunately, I am never satisfied and am constantly rebuilding and reworking entire units, and I have an incredibly challenging group this year in terms of behaviors. I feel like my heart just isn&rsquo;t in it this year — or, it is, but it&rsquo;s being beaten out every day by the horseshit I&rsquo;m dealing with. I&rsquo;m drowning in grading (especially for the college class — I&rsquo;m <em>weeks</em> behind). I stay for hours after school and it feels like I hardly make a dent. I keep telling myself that things will get better, but it&rsquo;s hard to see that light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>I have gone deeper into the world of fountain pens. I bought a LAMY Safari and Pilot Kakuno, both in extra fine; I like both but prefer the Kakuno (as it&rsquo;s slightly thinner). I also bought a converter for my Preppy, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m using it right — I feel like I&rsquo;m hardly pulling any ink. I might just try refilling cartridges with a syringe. I will repeat my call for any fountain pen sickos reading this to please give me guidance.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I finished <em>Accountable</em> by Dashka Slater because the deadline was up for the book group I joined. I enjoyed reading and discussing it, and it&rsquo;s upsetting how relevant it is to my school and experiences with today&rsquo;s students. The events at Albany are in no way an anomaly. I wish perhaps that the book offered solutions, but that&rsquo;s also naive of me — there are no easy answers to dismantling the effects of systemic racism and the dehumanizing vitriol teens encounter online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read maybe ten pages in <em>Villette</em> in the last few weeks. I am really enjoying it and want to read on, but it&rsquo;s been impossible to find the time and energy for it.</p>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still watching <em>Weeds</em>; I&rsquo;m practically done with it now. The later seasons aren&rsquo;t as bad as I remember, but they have nothing on the Agrestic seasons. They not <em>good</em>, but they&rsquo;re watchable, and that&rsquo;s enough for me right now.</p>
<p>Joe and I watched <em>Survivor 42</em> and are in the middle of <em>46</em> as part of our prep for <em>Survivor 50</em>. I liked <em>42</em> more than I expected (Dreya is Queen); <em>46</em> is a rewatch for me, but a good one — I love a season with goofy chaos like this.</p>
<p>Joe and I also spent Halloween re-watching <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>, though we both fell asleep somewhere around the Council of Elrond.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played a few more hours of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> over the last few weeks. I&rsquo;m still positive on it, but I&rsquo;m missing the diversity of <em>Tactics Advance</em> — I liked having the different races in my clan, but <em>Tactics</em> seems limited to just humans.</p>
<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>
<p>I listened to <em>Sound &amp; Color</em> by Alabama Shakes on a friend&rsquo;s recommendation. Surprisingly, I was able to place &ldquo;This Feeling&rdquo; from hearing it on <em>Fleabag</em>; otherwise, I found the album a little too coffee shop jam band to care much about it. I liked &ldquo;Drive By Baby,&rdquo; though.</p>
<p>The re-release of Mac Miller&rsquo;s <em>GO:OD AM</em> dropped for real this time, so I listened to those three bonus tracks. I&rsquo;d been listening to the leaked version of &ldquo;Carpe Diem&rdquo; for years at this point, so I&rsquo;m glad to at last have that out officially. It&rsquo;s a goofy song that I have a lot of affection for, and I don&rsquo;t think it (or the other two bonus tracks, which I think are bad) really fit tacked onto the end of <em>GO:OD AM</em> — the album has such an intentional build and ending, and then it&rsquo;s surprise! Here are two songs that probably didn&rsquo;t need to be released and one that could have been on a leaks EP or something.</p>
<p>There was a time in my life when I was listening to all the Mac leaks and keeping up as more dropped, but nowadays, I&rsquo;ve deleted all of them save for a few I really care about. Part of that has been enabled by the family <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS7rnvWOJrE">releasing official versions of some that I do really like, of course</a>. I suppose I&rsquo;m just holding on in hopes that the five or so<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that I hang onto drop officially. This is unlikely, however, because one of them was on the leaked <em>Balloonerism</em> but didn&rsquo;t make it to the official release. There&rsquo;s also &ldquo;The Sun Room&rdquo; (which eventually just became &ldquo;The Star Room&rdquo;), which probably would have been included on the re-release of <em>WMWTSO</em> if it was going to be anywhere. Consider this my requiem for an official drop of &ldquo;Pure,&rdquo; I guess, and then I can move on with my life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d give links to them but they pop up and then get copyright striked pretty quickly — and also they&rsquo;re inherently controversial. Clearly I have some mixed feelings on them.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

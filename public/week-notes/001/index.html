      <p>I <a href="https://cassie.ink/tags/media-log/">tried out doing monthly media logs</a> and found it difficult to stick to; it became daunting to log everything, and I put the unnecessary onus on myself to also write down detailed thoughts on everything. I&rsquo;m going to try out shorter weekly notes instead. I want to have a record of and reflect on things that are important to me, so the effort matters, but perhaps this will be easier to maintain.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;m hoping to use this space to share out blog posts and other web content that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed, too.</p>
<h1 id="doing">Doing</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I <strong>redesigned my bearblog</strong> from scratch. It&rsquo;s not much different than what I had before, but it&rsquo;s a dramatically simpler stylesheet. I&rsquo;m also loading the css from a server and embedding that within bearblog, which means I can use my preferred app (VSCodium) to write the code and bypass the bearblog editor.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to <strong>get back into running</strong> after I <a href="/breaking-silences">completed The Trevor Project&rsquo;s 53 mile challenge in June</a>. I haven&rsquo;t run since then until this week. I also picked up the <strong>Shokz OpenRun Mini</strong> on Prime Day which have been cool to try out on my runs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reading">Reading</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gordonhamburger.com/i-dream-of-game-pass/">I dream of a better Xbox Game Pass</a> by Phil Bothun</strong>, a great post on Game Pass&rsquo;s enshittification and how it could be more consumer-oriented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://emmasdilemmas.bearblog.dev/emerging/">Emerging</a> on Emma&rsquo;s Dilemmas</strong>. It&rsquo;s always lovely to see a new face on the bearblog discover page, and Emma&rsquo;s prose is fantastic. I can&rsquo;t wait to read more from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Cultural Competence Now</em> by Vernita Mayfield.</strong> I&rsquo;ve joined my school district&rsquo;s team DEI and we&rsquo;re using this book to frame our work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>The Odyssey</em> (Emily Wilson translation)</strong>. I taught the Gareth Hinds graphic novel version of <em>The Odyssey</em> to my students at the end of this past school year. They and I enjoyed it way more than anticipated, and it motivated me to take on reading the actual text for the first time. The introduction and translator&rsquo;s note in this version comprise a daunting 95 pages in my edition, so I&rsquo;ve read that, Book 1, and into Book 2. I love Wilson&rsquo;s ethos in approaching the translation and am enjoying it thus far.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="watching">Watching</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Gilmore Girls</em>, season three</strong> (one of the best, I think, if not the) <strong>and four</strong> (also one of my favorites). <em>Gilmore Girls</em> was a staple in my house growing up: we binged it as a family when I was in middle school and then endlessly rewatched the DVD collection. A friend of mine and her daughter have been watching it together, and they recently invited me over for a <em>Gilmore</em> night, which triggered the rewatch. I&rsquo;m happy to say that I still love the show dearly (despite its many faults). Joe has also (voluntarily!) joined in on my rewatch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Another Cinderella Story</em></strong>. Watched with a friend for nostalgia reasons (on her part). I&rsquo;m more of a Jennifer Coolidge fan, and the real life age gap between the romantic leads is disturbing â€” especially when Selena was a minor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="playing">Playing</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Stardew Valley</em></strong>&rsquo;s 1.6 update</li>
<li><strong><em>Picross e</em> series</strong> on my Switch, mostly when watching <em>Gilmore Girls</em></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="listening">Listening</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>BRAT</em>, Charli XCX</strong>. <em>BRAT</em> might be my album of the year; I love Charli and I think <em>BRAT</em> is her magnum opus. &ldquo;I think about it all the time&rdquo; has hit particularly hard, as I&rsquo;m having these same conversations with my partner right now.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong><em>Minecraft Volume Beta</em> and <em>Volume Alpha</em>, C418</strong>. I&rsquo;m not a big <em>Minecraft</em> player, but I love the soundtracks as background noise.</li>
<li><strong><em>Weather</em>, Tycho</strong>. I picked this up on vinyl this week. Great music to have in the background while working or relaxing.</li>
<li><strong><em>xx,</em> The xx.</strong> Another record store pickup. A moody, atmospheric album. I first got into The xx in 2012, after I heard &ldquo;Heart Skipped a Beat&rdquo; in, I believe, an H&amp;M.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> It was nice to return to the album and reminisce. I&rsquo;d forgotten how much I love &ldquo;Night Time.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Gilmore Guys</strong>. Joe loves podcasts and this one has motivated him to join me in the <em>Gilmore Girls</em> rewatch. I listened through to the show years ago, so it has been a little weird to revisit. We&rsquo;re in their early days (season two), which is rough: many of their guests hate <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, which does not make for fun listening. Things get better (and, in my opinion, the podcast gets funnier) as they go on. I do find all of the singing cringy now, which I don&rsquo;t recall from my first listen. <em>Gilmore Guys</em> was one of the first podcasts I really listened to, so perhaps now I&rsquo;m just much more exposed to different shows and styles.</li>

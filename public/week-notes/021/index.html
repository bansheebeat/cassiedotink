    <div class="barcode">
      
    </div>

      <p>I recently discovered some weirdness with my hard drives in my PC. It&rsquo;s a long story that isn&rsquo;t worth telling, but the end of it is that I bought an NVMe drive and am starting fresh with a clean install of Windows. It&rsquo;s fairly painless now that I have a drive that&rsquo;s <em>just</em> my files with a separate OS drive. I do have to reinstall and set up some apps again, but it has been a good opportunity to reassess the cruft I&rsquo;ve let build up on there over the years.</p>
<p>I went to the gym for the first time in a long time. A friend wants to join and get into the routine, so I&rsquo;m hoping that I can latch on to that momentum.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I&rsquo;m unfortunately glued to the news and despairing about the incoming presidency. I was never on TikTok (an intentional choice), but this whole ridiculous saga has emphasized to me the importance of having a space on the internet I own and control. I&rsquo;ve got plans for a direction I want my site to take, but all in time&hellip; For now, I&rsquo;m grateful to have this. Larger than that, though, I&rsquo;m terrified for what the future holds.</p>
<h1 id="reading">Reading</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m something like twenty pages from the end of <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em>. I need to just sit down and finish it, but work has been so hectic. I&rsquo;ve let that become an excuse.</p>
<h1 id="playing">Playing</h1>
<p>I had some friends over and played <em><strong>YARG</strong></em> with them. I&rsquo;m happy to have a backup and potential replacement for <em>Rock Band</em> as it is no longer maintained and I don&rsquo;t know if I see myself buying another home console ever (<em>Rock Band</em> is the only thing I turn my PS4 on for these days). I&rsquo;m a little disappointed that many of the fan-made charts out there are only for guitar, but there&rsquo;s still a great library to select from.</p>
<p>I played a little <strong><em>Vampire Survivors</em></strong>, for the first time in a long time; it&rsquo;s easy to pick up after months (years?) away, and it might be a good replacement for idle scrolling on social media.</p>
<h1 id="listening">Listening</h1>
<p>I listened to Mac Miller&rsquo;s <em><strong>Circles</strong></em> all the way through, I think for the first time since it released, after a friend became hyperfixated on &ldquo;Right&rdquo; (which I had not heard yet ‚Äî I never listened to the bonus tracks for the deluxe release). I had such mixed feelings about it when it came out. It&rsquo;s the first posthumous release I&rsquo;ve ever really <em>thought</em> about, and it just didn&rsquo;t grab me. I think it didn&rsquo;t feel like an authentic Mac release; I don&rsquo;t hold any ill will for anyone involved, and I think his family has handled his estate respectfully, but it was missing something ‚Äî but then, it was intended to be a new, different direction for Mac. Regardless, I wanted to see how I felt years on, so I jotted feelings down track-by-track.</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Circles&rdquo; - I&rsquo;ve loved this song from the jump. I heard a leaked version months before the release was announced and adored it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Complicated&rdquo; - The synths in this song are so bad, and the pitched up ab libs are awful. It feels like if someone else tried to make a Mac song and imitate Delusional Thomas features.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Blue World&rdquo; - I like it more than I remember, but it is a little grating.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Good News&rdquo; - A good song. I loved it when I first heard it, but it&rsquo;s grown stale for me. This is probably the song I&rsquo;d recommend to someone who wants to get into Mac but isn&rsquo;t big on rap.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I Can See&rdquo; - Again, the synths! They&rsquo;re awful. They sound like a jrpg hotel track and not in a good way.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Everybody&rdquo; - Another I like more than I recall. I like hearing Mac sing, but there&rsquo;s something bland in the instrumentation and production. It&rsquo;s a refined but dry track.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Woods&rdquo; - I love &ldquo;Woods.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s my favorite on the album.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hand Me Downs&rdquo; - Probably the most reminiscent of Mac&rsquo;s <em>Swimming</em> sound. Despite that, it&rsquo;s not my favorite; I like the Mac parts but not whoever is featured on it</li>
<li>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s On Me&rdquo; - Awful and repetitive; can&rsquo;t stand it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hands&rdquo; - Fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to it unless I was making it a point to listen through the entire album.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Surf&rdquo; - This is probably my most listened to song from the album. It&rsquo;s simple, but it works.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Once a Day&rdquo; - Another I like more than I remember. I think I like <em>Circles</em> most when it&rsquo;s pared down, simple tracks.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Right&rdquo; - I really like this one. The drums are sick.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Floating&rdquo; - No real feelings.</li>
</ol>
<p>It really is a pop album (hot take: a pop album for old people). I admire how Mac always experimented and evolved his sound ‚Äî this direction just wasn&rsquo;t for me, I guess.</p>
<p>And, of course, <strong><em>Balloonerism</em></strong> was released this week. I&rsquo;d heard all but two songs through listening to leaks, so it didn&rsquo;t hold any great surprises for me, but I love it still ‚Äî it&rsquo;s a fantastically weird, experimental little project that has some of my favorite Mac songs on it (namely, &ldquo;Do You Have a Destination?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s beautiful to hear the tracks properly mastered and to assuage some of my guilt about listening to leaks, but it&rsquo;s bittersweet, too: this feels pretty definitively like the last proper Mac release we will see aside from some bonus tracks and loosies on anniversary editions (please give me &ldquo;He Finally Sleeps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; üôè). <em>Blue Slide Park</em> aside (it&rsquo;s about the progress, the journey!), I think Mac was an incredible artist with so much still left to share when he passed. It&rsquo;s good to hear his voice and fresh songs, but they always linger with loss.</p>
<p>A coworker also recommended <strong>The New Pornographers</strong> to me; I listened to a few songs from <em>Twin Cinema</em> and found them aggressively fine, but I think perhaps I don&rsquo;t have headspace for anything that isn&rsquo;t Mac right now. I&rsquo;ll finish the album and give <em>Mass Romantic</em> a shot some other time.</p>

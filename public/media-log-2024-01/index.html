      <h1 id="tv">TV</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>One Tree Hill</em>, season six and seven</strong> - I&rsquo;ve been marathoning One Tree Hill on a friend&rsquo;s recommendation. By this season, we are well passed the &ldquo;good&rdquo; seasons, but it&rsquo;s still entertaining enough to watch â€” if only to count how many more car crashes the writers will introduce as plot lines. I think the early (1-4) seasons are a decent watch, but at this point, I&rsquo;m really just seeing it through to the end. Season seven has a novelty in seeing how a show pivots after losing its main character. I don&rsquo;t think <em>OTH</em> did so gracefully; they elevated some, generously, background characters into the main act and lumped on bunch of new ones at that. Some work better than others, but at least I&rsquo;m almost at the end.</li>
<li><strong><em>Kitchen Nightmares</em> (2023)</strong> - Years ago, I once came home to find my partner watching <em>Kitchen Nightmares</em> on YouTube. He&rsquo;s generally not a fan of reality or competition shows, so I asked him why he was watching it. He giggled and said, &ldquo;He [Gordon] just gets so mad.&rdquo; That led to me also watching a bunch of the show. This month I watched a gabi belle video in which she talked about the reboot, so I dipped in too. Gordon does indeed still get mad. When watching <em>Kitchen Nightmares</em>, I am always thinking of how much fun the show must be to edit. The editors make liberal use of the most unhinged sound effects imaginable. It&rsquo;s junk food TV, and who doesn&rsquo;t love junk food?</li>
<li><strong>Schitt&rsquo;s Creek</strong> - I&rsquo;ve been casually rewatching as my background noise / take a nap on the couch TV. Still hilarious and as good as the first time.</li>
<li><strong>The Bachelor</strong> - Two of my friends are big fans, so I&rsquo;m watching the current season with them. I&rsquo;ve never seen any <em>Bachelor</em> properties before this; I&rsquo;m mostly along for the ride. The show has yet to hit the reality TV highs that keep me looped in to shows like <em>America&rsquo;s Next Top Model</em> or <em>Survivor</em>, and the whole concept still feels quite skeezy to me.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>III</em>, The Lumineers</strong> - I have liked some of The Lumineers&rsquo; hits for years, but a friend really loves them, so I thought I&rsquo;d give <em>III</em> a shot. I understand it&rsquo;s a concept album with stories and characters; I really haven&rsquo;t delved into that. I&rsquo;m unsure if that&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t found it compelling or because I am trying to focus more on the <em>sound</em> rather than just the words (I&rsquo;ve always been more for the latter). <em>III</em> sounds great; it reminds me of how much I love the piano. It&rsquo;s the focal point of many songs on the album but also beautifully interspersed as a twinkly highlight or backdrop. Particular favorites are &ldquo;Donna&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Cell.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_KOpAnAMMA"><strong><em>another summer</em> (Nightcore Edition)</strong></a>, <strong>neverknowsbest</strong> - I didnt know what nightcore was until now. neverknowsbest is a friend&rsquo;s project and I really liked their debut album, so I gave this a shot. I can&rsquo;t say I really &ldquo;get&rdquo; nightcore, but I&rsquo;m constantly impressed by how talented my friends are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Modal Soul</em>, Nujabes</strong> - I&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of Nujabes-adjacent and inspired acts for years now (Tycho, emancipator, aether, Little People, etc.) but never the man himself. <em>Modal Soul</em> had some good moments (I love &ldquo;Feather&rdquo;), but it was mostly background noise that bordered on repetitive. Disappointed, but I&rsquo;ll try more Nujabes eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Never Hungover Again</em>, Joyce Manor</strong> - I love this album. It&rsquo;s simple and to the point; no song overstays its welcome. Each track exists just long enough to get a catchy tune through your ears then exits gracefully. I absolutely love &ldquo;Heart Tattoo&rdquo; in particular, to the point where I&rsquo;m actually considering getting one (maybe, sort of, not really, but also I might just).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Best Buds</em>, Mom Jeans</strong> - I had high hopes for this group based on the band name and that they are often mentioned in the same breath as Joyce Manor. <em>Best Buds</em> was a disappointment; the only song I found somewhat tolerable was &ldquo;Edward 40hands,&rdquo; but the rest is plagued by cloyingly nasal vocals that drag down some pleasant guitar licks.</p>

<h1 id="movies">Movies</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Fast X</em></strong> - an enjoyable entry in the <em>Fast</em> series, and I can officially say that I&rsquo;m caught up (aside from <em>Hobbes &amp; Shaw</em>; maybe that will feature later on this list). It&rsquo;s by far not the best <em>Fast</em> movie (I think that&rsquo;s still <em>Fast Five</em>), and I don&rsquo;t really care for Jason Momoa as a villain. There&rsquo;s something tired and a little problematic about the &ldquo;wacky sociopath&rdquo; trope, but the flair for drama and action is alive and well in this film. It&rsquo;s definitely the best of the post-7 films, but I can see how some might be turned off by the copious fan service and many celebrity cameos. Personally, I come to these films for cheap thrills and excess; I know what I&rsquo;m in for and don&rsquo;t begrudge them for indulging that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Saltburn</em></strong> - a friend has been obsessed with this film and we finally sat down to watch it. It was horrifying (in a good way) and beautifully shot (even if I don&rsquo;t love the choice to put it in 4:3). I don&rsquo;t often like the movies I watch (the ones that aren&rsquo;t <em>Fast</em> movies I guess); I hesitate to say that I <em>liked</em> this one so much as found it interesting and enjoyable. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d watch it again or recommend it to others. I appreciate that it was coherent and accessible in its themes compared to something like <em>The Lighthouse</em> (which I hated)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which often feels like it is showing you weird shit just to show you weird shit. <em>Saltburn</em> knows the themes it wants to explore and presents then well to the audience. Barry looks way too old, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</em></strong> and <strong><em>Crazy Rich Asians</em></strong> - Watched is a generous term; this was more &ldquo;talked through at a friend&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d seen the former several times already and have some affection for it. I&rsquo;d not seen <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> before; it didn&rsquo;t really capture my interest, but then, I didn&rsquo;t really try either.</p>
</li>

<p>The only thing <em>Saltburn</em> and <em>The Lighthouse</em> have in common is prominently featuring a jerk off scene, I think.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

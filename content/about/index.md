# hi, my name is cassie.

I'm an English teacher from New York. This is the home of the esoteric bullshit that I am incomprehensibly fixated on, which includes books, video games, music, and thinking way too much about everything.

this site is currently built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I edit my posts in Obsidian (with the help of [GitSync](https://github.com/ViscousPot/GitSync) on mobile) and sync them to a repo on [32bitcafe](https://32bit.cafe/). I use Cloudflare Pages to build and serve the site. The current theme is heavily inspired by Joyce Manor's *Never Hungover Again*, a very good album that everyone should listen to.

## Doing
I'm backporting a bunch of content from my old blogs so I can finally stop maintaining WordPress blogs. Here are the posts that I've moved over:

* [Revolutions](https://cassie.ink/revolutions) (2015-03-12)
* [Life is Strange Episode 1: Chrysalis](https://cassie.ink/life-is-strange-episode-1-chrysalis) (2015-02-05)
* [House of Leaves: Appendix II-E, The Three Attic Whalestoe Institute Letters (May 8th, 1987)](https://cassie.ink/house-of-leaves-appendix-ii-e-the-three-attic-whalestoe-institute-letters-may-8th-1987/) (2015-01-01)
* [Canopies and Drapes: Emmy the Great’s Twist on the Classic Breakup Song](https://cassie.ink/canopies-and-drapes/) (2014-11-09)
* [Princess Bubblegum & Marceline: Still Just Almost Girlfriends](https://cassie.ink/princess-bubblegum-marceline-still-just-almost-girlfriends/) (2014-08-14)

Sorry for unintentional pings on my rss feed; also, be aware that a lot of these are vey old (like, ten years) and don't necessarily reflect who I am as a person today! I'm trying to be better about preserving and sharing my writing, so I suppose that means I must submit to [the mortifying ordeal of being known](https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/i-know-what-you-think-of-me/). Some of these pieces, while flawed, I am still fond of — particularly the *Life is Strange* one.

I've continued my desk journey from last week, by which I mean I abandoned the Ergotron arm and ordered a Pixio PS1D instead. The Pixio arm feels cheaper in places, but the clamp is of reasonable size, and on the whole, it was *leagues* easier to set up than the Ergotron arm. The Ergotron comes pre-assembled, it's heavy, and you have to affix the monitors to the arms. The Pixio went together in pieces (with decent directions), which made it entirely feasible to do on one's own. You don't have to climb under your desk to clamp it down! There are detachable VESA plates so you can just slide your monitors right on! The clamp is a reasonable size! I'm still figuring out final positioning for the monitors themselves, but I'm really happy with how much it's cleaned up my desk setup.

This whole process was stressful, but the Pixio enabled me to use the steel plates I'd ordered, so I no longer have fears of my monitors crashing down on me one day. All's well that ends & all.[^2]

## Playing
I'm still playing *Fields of Mistria*, although I have had a few mid-day game crashes this week. The game is in early access, so I can't complain too much, but it's the first time it's happened to me. It's frustrating to lose progress, but I suppose I should get into the habit of saving a few times throughout the day.[^1]

## Listening
I listened to [*SUCK UP ALL THE OXYGEN* by Hutch Harris](hutchharris.bandcamp.com/album/suck-up-all-the-oxygen) because I saw the cover on Bandcamp and thought it was funny. The album was fine but not for me. There was a time in my life when I probably would have been really into this, but it's not now.

I picked up my *All We Know is Falling* listen from last week, too.
6. Never Let This Go - a nice build and pleasant to listen to, but it blends in with a lot of the rest of the album (yet fails to stand out).
7. Whoa - I always loved this one; great energy that lets me overlook the silly lyrics.
8. Conspiracy - forgettable
9. Franklin - I was so surprised by how fond of this song I still am. It's sweet; the backing vocals are a bit distracting — I'd rather they were just Hayley, but I understand that they were going for a duet.
10. My Heart - I was listening to a decent rip of this album but this song still somehow sounds like a super compressed 96kbps MP3. The screaming in this song is also so atonal — it feels like a studio note given what was "in" at the time.
11. Oh Star - another forgettable one for me; I don't really like slow songs in general I think and especially not when Paramore does them.

I went back to *fishmonger* by underscores. I really love this album (still). I love just about every song on it, but "Del mar county fair (2008)" is hitting for me in particular lately.

[^1]: *Mistria* gives you this option; *Stardew* does not... but I've never had a mid-day crash in *Stardew.*

[^2]: I still have the Ergotron arm. I'm hoping to sell it locally on Facebook Marketplace to get some of my money back, so things aren't over just yet.

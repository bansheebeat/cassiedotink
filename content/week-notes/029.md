I listened to [*SUCK UP ALL THE OXYGEN* by Hutch Harris](hutchharris.bandcamp.com/album/suck-up-all-the-oxygen) because I saw the cover on Bandcamp and thought it was funny. The album was fine but not for me. There was a time in my life when I probably would have been really into this, but it's not now.

I picked up my *All We Know is Falling* listen from last week, too.
6. Never Let This Go - a nice build and pleasant to listen to, but it blends in with a lot of the rest of the album (yet fails to stand out).
7. Whoa - I always loved this one; great energy that lets me overlook the silly lyrics.
8. Conspiracy - forgettable
9. Franklin - I was so surprised by how fond of this song I still am. It's sweet; the backing vocals are a bit distracting — I'd rather they were just Hayley, but I understand that they were going for a duet.
10. My Heart - I was listening to a decent rip of this album but this song still somehow sounds like a super compressed 96kbps MP3. The screaming in this song is also so atonal — it feels like a studio note given what was "in" at the time.
11. Oh Star - another forgettable one for me; I don't really like slow songs in general I think and especially not when Paramore does them.

I listened to [*SUCK UP ALL THE OXYGEN* by Hutch Harris](hutchharris.bandcamp.com/album/suck-up-all-the-oxygen) because I saw the cover on Bandcamp and thought it was funny. The album was fine but not for me. There was a time in my life when I probably would have been really into this, but it's not now.

I listened to Rainbow Kitten Surprise's newest album, *bones*. It's good but not great. For reference, I think *RKS* is basically a perfect album (except for "Run," which sucks); I really like *Seven + Mary* and *How to: Friend, Love, Freefall*; and while I think *Love Hate Music Box* needed an editor, I appreciate how it tries to move their sound in a new direction.[^1] *bones* feels like an attempt to rollback the pop-oriented *Love Hate Music Box* and return to the refined rock of *How to* and *RKS*, but it's missing the sparkle those two had. Instead, it feels like a band that's simply comfortable in a sound. That's not a bad thing, but it lacks the magic and sparkle of its two heaviest influences. "Hell Nah," "bones," and "Tropics" were the highlights for me, but none of them are even close to *RKS* and *How to* for me. They're songs I don't mind to have in the background, whereas I consciously return to songs like "Cold Love," "All's Well That Ends," and "Moody Orange" constantly.

I listened to [*NULL* by NULL](https://null818.bandcamp.com/album/null) on [Brendon Bigley's recommendation](https://wavelengths.online/posts/a-good-ep-null-ep-by-null) and found it  borderline unlistenable. I don't mind noise punk ([Perfect Pussy's "I"](https://prrfectpussy.bandcamp.com/track/i) is an all-timer for me), but this absolutely did not hit. At least it was short.

[^1]: I'd have been happy with more of what they had been doing, of course, but I also appreciate a band that innovates and evolves.

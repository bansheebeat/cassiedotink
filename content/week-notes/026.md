## Doing
I'm teaching (*adjunct lecturing*) a college class in the fall for the first time. I'm starting to put together my syllabus and lesson plans. I have a lot of resources from the previous professor (who is a friend), but I'm also trying to do my own thing. It's a lot of work and I'm very stressed about it.

## Watching
Joe and I watched through Austin Walker's Let's Play of *Knights of the Old Republic II* â€” or at least, what he has out right now, which is through Dxun.

## Doing
I'm teaching (*adjunct lecturing*) a college class in the fall for the first time. I'm starting to put together my syllabus and lesson plans. I have a lot of resources from the previous professor (who is a friend), but I'm also trying to do my own thing. It's a lot of work and I'm very stressed about it.

## Reading
I'm continuing to work my way through *Mood Machine*. I'm still enjoying it, but I have a lot of books to get through for my syllabus, so I might need to take a break. Luckily, those are all young adult books, so they go by quick.
## Watching
Joe and I watched through Austin Walker's Let's Play of *Knights of the Old Republic II* — or at least, what he has out right now, which is through Dxun.

## Playing
I haven't gotten to play *Mistria* at all this week because we've been in and out of town, but it is very much on my mind. I don't use my Switch much, but I would play the hell out of this game in handheld — or perhaps on a Steam Deck...

## Listening
I'm still coming down from the high of the Rainbow Kitten Surprise concert, so I've mostly been listening to them (and shuffles on car rides). Nothing new or notable!

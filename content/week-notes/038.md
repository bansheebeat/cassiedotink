This week was *nuts*.

My birthday was Monday; I went right from teaching middle school to teaching my college course in the evening. I got home around 7:00pm, showered, ate dinner, and felt down — not because I had a particularly bad day, but it just felt like a bunch of stress came crashing down. I guess I hoped something completely arbitrary like a birthday would wash away the weeks of discontent, but alas.

I won't get into the play-by-play, to protect the privacy of the people involved and because it really isn't that interesting, but on Tuesday, I caught wind that there was a sudden opening in the English department at the high school in my school district. By Friday, I was (tearfully) letting my middle schoolers know that I had made the decision to take the job and would be moving on around the end of January. It's been a real rollercoaster — a plain example of how one's life can change in moments. I wrote out an email to my current coworkers explaining the decision, which I'll reproduce in part here:

> I became a teacher for three reasons: I love literature, I love writing, and I love children. I have the best job in the world because I get to fulfill those passions every day. But increasingly in the last few years, I've longed for the literature that you find at the high school level, the writing that you can push older kids to do, and most of all, seeing kids grow as readers and thinkers over several years... Ordinarily, I'd never dream of leaving a job midyear like this, but opportunity came knocking, and I'm not one to turn it down. I've had a heavy heart the last few days as I weighed the decision, the foremost of which is that I hate to leave my students in the middle of the year like this. But I also know that this isn't goodbye — it's see you later. 

I've been giddy — and anxious and hysterical and paranoid and about a dozen other emotions — ever since I made the decision. I know it's going to be a *ton* of work, a huge challenge to adjust to a new building and culture. But there's so much that I'm looking forward to, and I feel newly invigorated by the prospect of a fresh start and a new adventure. There's a lot of logistics to figure out, but I'm thrilled. More to come on this in the weeks ahead!

On the weekend, I played around with Jellyfin a bit. I'm currently pretty deep into Plex but would prefer to use open source software. I found Jellyfin to be a bit slow and clunky (which could well be a limitation of my server) on both the web app and the Roku app, but it's mostly useable for movies and TV. I hit a lot more walls for my music. I have a library approaching 20k songs[^1] that I've spent a lot of time combing through on Plex (Plexamp, specifically) to star tracks, build playlists, etc. I probably could transfer that with a not insignificant amount of effort, but the bigger hurdle is where to listen. I've played around with Symfonium on my phone (which already supports Plex) and like it well enough, but there's no desktop parallel. I could go back to foobar2000, but I like having one app that's synchronized across desktop and mobile. So it seems I'm sticking with Plex/Plexamp for the time being.[^2]

I'm also really excited that [omg.lol recently started a Forgejo instance](https://omglol.news/2025/11/20/say-hello-to-sourcetube-the-omg-lol-community-code-forge). I've been a happy customer with them for over a year, and while I recently migrated my git repos to [32bitcafe's Gitea](https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie), they don't have a working Actions workflow, so I'm right now mirroring the repo to Github and then deploying to Cloudflare Pages. Once omg.lol launches an Actions Runner on Forgejo, I'm planning to set up a build script that deploys to (probably) Nearly Free Speech so I can start ending my reliance on Microsoft and Cloudflare.

[^1]: this is sicko-level shit

[^2]: I am not particularly unhappy with Plex, to be clear,  but it is a closed-source app and I'm not sure I trust them with my data. But it sure as hell is better than Spotify/Apple Music/et al.

## Doing

## Reading
I finished reading *Return of the King* this week, completing a long-standing personal mission to read *The Lord of the Rings*. I [wrote up a big long post](https://git.32bit.cafe/cassie/cassiedotink.git) with my history with the series and my thoughts.

## Watching

I've been rewatching *Downton Abbey*. I'm in season two right now; I'm debating whether to finish the series (I never watched past season five, I think) or if I'll stop when they kill off some major characters in season three. I am glad to confirm that I was always right: Mary is the main character and the best character.

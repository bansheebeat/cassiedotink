## Doing

## Reading
I re-read Gene Luen Yang's *American Born Chinese*, which is the last text for my college course. I first read this nine years ago when I took the class; I remember enjoying it and finding the twist novel. This time around, I flew through and was surprised by how much of it I remembered — in my head, it was a lot longer and more complicated. It's a book I would have considered for my middle school curriculum if I was staying at the grade level.

## Watching

## Playing
I've gone back to *Final Fantasy Tactics*. I'm still really enjoying it, though the long breaks I've taken have left me a little lost when it comes to all the different factions and individuals vying for power in the game's plot. I really like a lot of the major characters (Delita, mostly, and Agrias), and so I'm choosing to focus more on their individual, emotional journeys rather than all the intricate political machinations. I'm keeping up with the broad strokes of the story just fine. It seems like a notable change from the me of 15 years ago that read the entire *Mass Effect* codex, and I'm not sure what to attribute that to. The lore of *Tactics* is much drier, I suppose, and I think my priorities have changed along with the time I have to actually sit down and play games — now that my play sessions are fewer and farther between, I'm not really eager to spend them reading a damn book off the screen.

I'm back on my *Fields of Mistria* bullshit now that we're home. At this point, I've exhausted a lot of the content currently available, which isn't a bad place to be — I've *seen* just about everything (except heart events, which I really don't interact with in these types of games) and now can focus on 100% things and beautifying my farm. There's still a few things that will unlock at higher town ranks, and I can keep looking forward to the regular updates.

## Listening
I listened to *Tapestry* by Carole King. I'm not really sure why — I knew it wasn't really going to be for me. It's a legendary album and I'm sure deserves its place in music history, but as an individual listener in 2025, I found it a bit ho-hum.

I also listened to [*I Love My Computer* by Ninajirachi](https://ninajirachi.bandcamp.com/album/i-love-my-computer), which fucking bangs. Recommended for fans of Charli XCX's earlier, more PC music-adjacent era[^1], and general hyperpop/EDM folks. Listen to "Fuck My Computer," "Delete," and "All I Am" for a taste of what the whole album is like; I'm particularly enamored with "Sing Good," but the whole album feels like an ode to teenage creativity and terminally online behavior, both of which I am deeply nostalgic for.

[^1]: I love *brat* and believe it brought PC Music's innovative sound to the mainstream, but that also works against it: it's somewhat diluted compared to the bizarre, abstract, creative shit that PC Music and similar artists put out over the years.

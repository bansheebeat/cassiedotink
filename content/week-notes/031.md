## Doing
I've backported the last of the posts from my old blog! These two were the most involved because they were long and involved creating some new shortcodes (particularly the games one).
* [My Top Ten Video Games from the 2010s](/my-top-ten-video-games-from-the-2010s/) (2019-11-13)
* [My Top Ten Albums from the 2010s](/my-top-ten-albums-from-the-2010s) (2019-12-20)[^1]
I've therefore cancelled my Digital Ocean droplet[^2] and can stop worrying about keeping a WordPress install up to date. All links to bansheebeat.org should now redirect here. I still love the the domain name and might look for something fun to do with it one day.[^3]

## Listening
I'm listening to a lot of Trust Fund lately — I've listened to *songs* of theirs for years but never really full albums. I went through all of *"No one's coming for us"* (listen to "Sadness," "Cut me out," and "Unwieldy Foam"), and I've kept on with *Don't Let Them Begin* from last week (really feeling "The Coolest Guy" and "Seance"). There's a kind of mopey indie slacker rock vibe to a lot of these, which I suppose reflects how I'm feeling now.

[^1]: *Kept* definitely benefited from recency bias; I was super into it when I wrote this post. I'd move *Swimming* up higher on the list today, but I think the intention of the post is to capture how I felt in that moment of time — not necessarily to create a perennial representation of my tastes.

[^2]: I'm now $5/mo richer.

[^3]: Something with music would be fitting. Maybe if I spin off a section of this site for album ratings? I've always wanted to start a database to track my listening... but I'd also rather have everything on one domain.

[^4]: heavy breathing but the nervous and anxious kind

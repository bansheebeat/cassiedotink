I moved domains, again.

This blog started on bearblog.dev as cassie.land. Bearblog is a great platform, but I [wanted a challenge in my life](https://cassie.ink/what%27s-this-%28and-how-it-works%29/), I guess, so I taught myself to use Hugo and moved to esotericbullshit.net (cassie.land was repurposed for my NAS). I love the esotericbullshit moniker and URL — it makes me laugh — but as it turns out, it's kind of hard to share your link when it contains profanity.[^1] Perhaps that's copium for a growing domain purchasing addiction, but I intend to make this one stick.

I have a long history with blogging. I posted on livejournal from 2007-2012 several times a week, with mundane accounts of my day and fragile mental state[^2]. In 2013, I moved to a private Dreamwidth blog, and then to a WordPress blog in 2014. Each time I moved, I had the compulsion to backport all of my old writing, but I liked the idea of a fresh start — and I felt each time that I was a new, improved version of me with a distinct voice.

But as I plumb through my livejournal archive, I've realized: wherever I go, I'm still myself. And that's the impetus behind **cassie.ink**: no bullshit, no hiding. It's me and my name, and if I get sick of that, we have bigger problems.

I don't know that I have the bravery to bring over *all* of that old content, but perhaps *some* of it. I'm not sure what that will look like. I admire, for example, Jedda, whose [flashbackFriday series](https://notes.jeddacp.com/archive/?q=flashbackFriday) unearths her teenage livejournal entries. Maybe the elegant solution is to backport some of the content with a warning that it's old and I'm smarter and wiser and less fucking annoying now?[^3] Import the old content but make it difficult (impossible) to access unless I link to it somewhere else? That's all for me to figure out.

For now — here I am, again, committing to blog, again.[^4]

[^1]: this is not me censoring myself: I will continue to rampantly write fun words like fuck and shit
[^2]: I'm told that's what the platform is for
[^3]: most likely
[^4]: I also understand hugo and git *way* better now — turns out that capriciously rebuilding your websites over and over again means you learn something!

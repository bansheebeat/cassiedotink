This past year has emphasized to me the impermanence of online platforms. I have quit reddit with the third-party API shutdowns, and while I am probably better off for it, it does feel like losing one of the bastions of the internet I once knew. I regret to inform that I am officially an old person on the internet; I yearn for the days of hyper-specific Geocities pages with incredibly useful information written by a thirteen year old screaming into the void (and for the days where our search engines actually directed us to that information rather than some circuitous tripe written by AI that packs in every SEO keyword without actually saying anything).

I have channeled these ruminations into redesigning my blog for the eight hundredth time, but this time, I am also resolving to use it more. I have thoughts I like to share and a desire to catalogue the things I am interested in, and it just doesn't seem viable any more to do so on any online platforms that I don't own. I feel, in a sense, "homeless" on the internet, and I think it is time we make those homes on ground that won't be pulled out from under us with the passing whimsy of a manchild CEO. (In case there is any ambiguity, I am indeed referring to Elon Musk and Steve Huffman.)

Will I follow through on that promise? We'll see. In the past, I have been caught up in the idea that this blog should be for long-form posts with deep thinking and planning. Maybe that should still be true, but I also want to embrace the passing whimsy and interests that occupy my time. Thanks for reading and joining me on the ride.

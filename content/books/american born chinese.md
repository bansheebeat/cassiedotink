From [my week notes](https://cassie.ink/week-notes/39/):

> I first read this nine years ago when I took the class [that I'm teaching right now]; I remember enjoying it and finding the twist novel. This time around, I flew through and was surprised by how much of it I remembered — in my head, it was a lot longer and more complicated. It’s a book I would have considered for my middle school curriculum if I was staying at the grade level.

I'd recommend *American Born Chinese* to anyone who likes middle grades coming of age stories that blend in classic mythology and folktales.
